323294,Mexico mourns Navy cadets killed in Brooklyn Bridge ship crash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7807vexn0go,"Mexicans are mourning the death of two young Navy cadets who were killed on Saturday when the training tall ship ARM Cuauhtémoc crashed into Brooklyn Bridge. América Sánchez, 20, and 23-year-old Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos were among the 277 crew members on board the Mexican Navy's sailing ship when its three masts snapped as they hit the bridge. According to Mexican media, Sánchez was one of the cadets who was standing on top of the rigging at the time of the accident. Twenty-two other crew members were injured, three of them critically, the Mexican Navy said. The commander of the Mexican Navy, Admiral Pedro Raymundo Morales, said all the crew members well enough to travel would be taken back to their homeland soon. The body of América Sánchez is scheduled to be transferred to the Naval Academy in her home state of Veracruz later on Monday. Her mother, Rocío Hernández, described the 20-year-old cadet as ""an exemplary daughter"" who was ""a dedicated student"" aiming to become a naval engineer. Standing before an impromptu altar adorned with flowers and photos of América Sánchez dressed up for her ""quinceañera"", the party marking her 15th birthday, Ms Hernández paid tribute to her daughter. ""She was a warrior, a soldier who didn't give up, who always fought for her goals,"" she said, adding that her daughter only had one year left until her graduation. ""They [the Navy] will hold a private ceremony in her honour at the Veracruz Naval Academy for her and then I will bring her home,"" Ms Hernández said thanking all of her daughter's relatives, friends and teachers, whom she asked ""to remember her [América]  with affection"". In San Mateo del Mar, a coastal town in Oaxaca state, friends and relatives of Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos have also been paying their respects after the young cadet was confirmed as the second fatal victim of the crash. His friends told local media that the 23-year-old had always dreamt of following in his father's footsteps and becoming a sailor. Being on board the Cuauhtémoc, also known as ""Knight of the Seas"", had been his greatest wish, they recalled. ""The sea saw him being born and the sea was a witness to his passing,"" one friend to media, adding that ""all of us who knew him will remember him as a role model of an intelligent youth"". The investigation into how the accident happened is still under way. ""This is the start of a long process,"" Michael Graham of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said during a briefing on Monday. ""We will not be drawing any conclusions, we will not speculate."" Mr Graham said there was ""no significant structural damage"" to the load-bearing elements of the Brooklyn Bridge. His colleague, Brian Young, provided a preliminary timeline of events on the night of 17 May. New York police officials previously said it appeared that the Cuauhtémoc had lost power as it was leaving New York Harbour and was dragged towards Brooklyn Bridge by the current. Its three masts, measuring more than 48m, hit the base of the bridge, which -according to the New York transport department's website - only has a clearance of  41.1m. All three masts collapsed and video footage taken by bystanders shows some of the crew members dangling from the yards and sails. Mr Graham said that his team would consider the status of the engine during their investigation. ""On behalf of the NTSB, I wish to express my most sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in this terrible tragedy,"" he said.  Mexico's Navy Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said in a statement the results of any investigation would be followed with ""total transparency and responsibility"". The Cuauhtémoc left Acapulco, Mexico, on 6 April on a tour that included stops in New York and Aberdeen, Scotland, for the city's Tall Ships race in July.

623866,Spanish PM calls for Israel ban at Eurovision,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7zx836v6do,"The Spanish prime minister has called for Israel to be banned from the Eurovision Song Contest over its military action in Gaza. Pedro Sánchez notedRussia has been banned from the contest since 2022following its invasion of Ukraine, and said there should not be ""double standards"". Israel came second in the contest's grand final in Switzerland on Saturday, but topped the public vote - with Spanish viewers giving Israel the maximum 12 points. Israeli minister for diaspora affairs, Amichai Chikli, ridiculed Sánchez with a social media post that said the vote had been a ""slap in the face"" for the Spanish PM, ""which we have heard here in Jerusalem"". BBC News has asked Eurovision organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for comment. Speaking at a news conference in Madrid, Sánchez said: ""Nobody was up in arms when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began three years ago and [Russia] had to leave international competitions and could not take part, as we have just seen, in Eurovision. ""Therefore Israel shouldn't either, because what we cannot allow is double standards in culture."" He also expressed solidarity with ""the people of Palestine who are experiencing the injustice of war and bombardment"". ""Spain's commitment to international law and human rights must be constant and must be coherent,"" he said. ""Europe's should be too."" Sánchez and his government, which officially acknowledged a Palestinian state last year, have been harsh critics of Israel, and last week in Congress the prime minister referred to the country as ""a genocidal state"". Israel has strenuously denied accusations of genocide, and its foreign ministry summoned the Spanish ambassador for a formal reprimand over Sánchez's ""serious remarks"". At Eurovision, Spain's televote saw the country award Israel maximum points for its song New Day Will Rise by Yuval Raphael. Spain's broadcast networkRTVE has since requested an auditof the votes. Ahead of the Eurovision final on Saturday, RTVE aired a message in support of Palestinians - despite being warned to avoid references to Gaza by the EBU.

239288,JD Vance invites Pope Leo to White House after Vatican talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2rpn3p9ro,"US Vice-President JD Vance has invited Pope Leo to make an official visit to Washington following a ""cordial"" meeting the Vatican, the White House has confirmed. Vance handed the pontiff a letter from President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump inviting him to visit ""as soon as [he] possibly can"", White House  spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. In a statement, the Holy See said both sides had expressed satisfaction with relations between the US and Vatican during face-to-face talks on Monday. The meeting comes after Vance - a practicing Catholic - joined other dignitaries and worshippers at the Pope's inaugural mass on Sunday. Religious freedom and cooperation between church and state were also discussed  on Monday, it was reported, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also taking part. ""Finally, there was an exchange of views on current international issues with a shared call for respect for humanitarian and international law in conflict zones, and support for negotiated solutions among the parties involved,"" reads the Holy See's statement. The papal audience lasted 45 minutes, Vance's spokesperson said. It took place behind closed doors without reporters present. There was a customary exchange of gifts, with Vance handing Pope Leo a t-shirt for the Chicago Bears - an American football team from the Pope's birthplace - complete with his name. Vance's office said he also gave the pontiff two books by St Augustine. The Pope, meanwhile, gave the vice-president a bronze sculpture with the inscription ""peace is a fragile flower"" in Italian, and a picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace - the Pope's official residence. The Vatican said Vance also held positive talks with Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, who is responsible for the Holy See's diplomatic relations. Pope Leo, who became the first American to lead the Catholic Church earlier this month, has previously appeared to make veiled criticisms of Vance and the Trump administration's migration stance. In February, an X account under Leo's name shared criticism of the White House's plans for mass deportations of migrants. That same month, the account also shared a link to an opinion piece titled: ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others."" The Vatican has not responded to previous requests from BBC News to confirm whether the account belonged to Pope Leo. On Sunday, Vance said the United States was ""very proud"" of the Chicago-born pontiff. ""Certainly our prayers go with him as he starts this very important work,"" the vice-president said. América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died when the tall ship lost power and drifted into the bridge.

197239,Searches continue at farm where human remains were found,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz63d76340xo,"Searches are continuing at an Irish farm where partial human remains were found. The discovery on Friday was made almost two months after County Kerry farmer, Michael Gaine, went missing. Police are continuing to question a man in his 50s who was arrested on Monday on suspicion of murdering the 56 year old. A process to formally identify the partial human remains is under way. The ongoing search at the farm near Kenmare is being led by specialist teams. Gardaí (Irish police) are being supported by an engineering specialist search team from the Irish Defence Forces. Mr Gaine was reported missing from his home on Friday 21 March. It was initially treated as a missing persons case before being upgraded to a homicide on 29 April. There was always a sense of foreboding after Mr Gaine vanished in March. His disappearance was one of those times when many people got an early feeling that ""something is not right"" about the case. But nothing could have prepared the farmer's family and his community for the grim discovery of partial human remains on land beside his farm almost two months after he went missing. People who knew Mr Gaine have been left reeling by how the discovery was made last Friday during the spreading of slurry across fields. The shock was compounded by follow-up searches for more body parts in the fields and in a slurry tank on the adjoining farm. The gruesome developments have rocked the community and sent shockwaves around Ireland. The country was gripped by the original disappearance of the busy and popular sheep and cattle farmer in a mountainous area close to Moll's Gap, along the world-renowned Ring of Kerry tourist route. He was reported missing a day after he made an early morning trip to a shop in the nearby town of Kenmare. His car was found at his farm, which is at a separate location to his home, and some of his personal items were in the car. But there was no trace of the farmer. That prompted an extensive search for miles around the rugged and remote terrain where he lived and worked. Initially, hundreds of people joined police along with search and rescue teams as they combed the area trying to find Mr Gaine or any clues about his whereabouts. Gardaí then requested the community to step back from the search to allow more space for investigators and search and rescue experts. That prompted immediate speculation that this might ultimately turn-out to be more than a missing person case. Towards the end of April, there was confirmation that the investigation had been upgraded to homicide. That meant Gardaí believed Mr Gaine was dead and someone else was involved. But there was still no breakthrough until last Friday. A machine was being used to spread slurry on fields beside his farm when the operator was stunned to discover what appeared to be parts of human remains. The alarm was raised, and the lands and farm were sealed off and declared a crime scene to allow for forensic searches in the fields and in a slurry tank on the farm. It is well known that the slurry facility on the farm was searched during the early stages of Mr Gaine's disappearance. Some people are now wondering if the search teams missed the body parts during their initial searches or if the body or partial remains were deposited there more recently. It is a complex and challenging investigation, and it therefore likely to be some time before investigators have all the answers about what happened to Mr Gaine. Copyright 2025 BBC.

524981,Solving the mystery of a dinosaur mass grave at the 'River of Death',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k3x8lmje1o,"Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale. Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation. Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the ""River of Death"" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die? Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer. Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as ""palaeo gold"". As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge. ""That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,"" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears. ""Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery."" BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues. Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generatingnew discoveries. The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life. These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, thefour-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss. The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre. So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside. ""It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,"" she tells us. ""It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America. ""More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here."" Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer. The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals. ""It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,"" says Prof Bamforth. And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem. Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks. No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up. A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud. Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. ""Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,"" he says. The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land. Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed ""Big Sam"". He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. ""All the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,"" he says. ""But its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there."" Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old. Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd – as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike. All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time? ""We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,"" Prof Bamforth says. All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders. Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. ""These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all."" Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone. But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists. ""We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,"" says Prof Bamforth. ""That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things."" As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.

963870,"US Supreme Court lets Trump end deportation protections for 350,000 Venezuelans",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg78471n85o,"The US Supreme Court has said it will allow the Trump administration to terminate deportation protections for some 350,000 Venezuelans in the US. The ruling lifts a hold that was placed by a California judge that kept Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in place for Venezuelans whose status' would have expired last month. Temporary Protected Status allows people to live and work in the US legally if their home countries are deemed unsafe due to things like countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other ""extraordinary and temporary"" conditions. The ruling marks a win for US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly tried to use the Supreme Court to enact immigration policy decisions. The Trump administration wanted to end protections and work permits for migrants  with TPS in April 2025, more than a year before they were originally supposed to end in October 2026. Lawyers representing the US government argued the California federal court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, had undermined ""the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,"" when it stopped the administration from ending protections and work permits in April. Ahilan Arulanantham, who represents TPS holders in the case, told the BBC he believes this to be ""the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern US history"". ""That the Supreme Court authorized this action in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking,"" Mr Arulanantham said. ""The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court's decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations."" Because it was an emergency appeal, justices on the Supreme Court did not provide a reasoning for the ruling. The court's order only noted one judge's dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In August, the Trump administration is also expected to revoke TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians. The ruling on Monday by the Supreme Court marks the latest in a series of decisions on immigration policies from the high court that the Trump administration has left them to rule on. Last week, the administration asked the Supreme Court to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuela immigrants. Along with some of their successes, the Trump administration was dealt a blow on Friday when the high court blocked Trump from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants in north Texas. Trump had wanted to use the centuries-old law to swiftly deport thousands from the US, but Supreme Court judges questioned if the president's action was legal. América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died when the tall ship lost power and drifted into the bridge.

943106,Brussels hails UK deal as 'new chapter' - but much is yet to be written,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4gwvezvvko,"""We're turning a page,"" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday after the bloc's first summit with the UK since Brexit. ""We're opening a new chapter."" It is not the first page that has been turned in the post-Brexit period, but it is potentially the most significant. The two sides have now struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas that are still up for negotiation. For Brussels, this negotiation was a chance to bring Britain – a major defence power – closer in a time of geopolitical turbulence. And to address what some member states see as irritating hangovers from Brexit. For years, there was a ""don't touch it"" mentality when it came to taking a broad look at the Brexit settlement, according to one EU diplomat. It all involved ""too much politics"" with fears it could all ""go wrong."" Remember, up until the2023 Windsor Framework agreement, London and Brussels were bogged down in a protracted dispute over trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. Then, in 2024, a new government won power in the UK - the more EU-friendly Labour Party. Officials in Brussels had long voiced exasperation – even distrust – with prior Conservative administrations, a party with a vocal Brexit-backing contingent. Some Brexit supporters are now castigating a deal that they say amounts to a sell-out of sovereignty to EU bureaucrats. Diplomats in Brussels, however, insist that this is a ""normalisation"" of relations between neighbours who still look at the world in a broadly similar way. That being said, there was evident satisfaction in EU circles about locking in fishing quotas for 12 years. When I checked with one diplomat about that detail, they initially replied with a smiley face emoji. Another said: ""The deal is balanced—arguably with favourable terms for the EU—and simply shows that splendid isolation is not an option in today's climate."" Of course, the EU will want to highlight its ""wins"" in a negotiation with a former member state who badly shook the bloc by leaving. Nevertheless, coastal countries - notably France – will be happy at not having to endure annual fish quota talks, for now. It was, in the end I'm told, quid pro quo. The EU got its fishing deal. In return, it'll be easier for UK businesses to export agri-food products – although that element hasn't been finalised. Also yet to be ironed out are theplans for youth mobility – which would allow young people to study or work more easily between Britain and the EU. That was a particularly important goal for countries like Germany, anxious to win better access to an English-speaking country with prestigious universities. Another key point for Berlin was the new defence and security partnership. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's unpredictable White House have ripped up the rules on European security. Time has been something of a healer – but the events of recent years have also created a sense of urgency. Better ties with Britain, which remains a major defence player, is a no-brainer – now more than ever – for mainland Europe as it tries to scale up investment and capabilities. Nations like Germany – which only recently hit the 2% Nato spending target – are acutely aware that they have been left exposed by the dramatic global developments of recent years. But, of course, most of this deal is an agreement in principle; a statement of intent on issues also ranging across cyber security, energy and migration. ""I think it's a good step,"" another EU diplomat told me. ""It's good to test the waters for practical cooperation and what can be done. Let's take it from there."" There is still a watchful wariness in Brussels about Britain's fraught and divisive debate about relations with the EU. All the specifics, which have yet to be negotiated, could stir up further political storms whether that's on political compromises or cost. This ""reset"" may not change the big fundamentals of Brexit - the UK remains out of the single market and customs union- but it does commit London and Brussels to doing a lot more talking as they try to fill the many gaps that lie within this long list of ambitions. That means there will be a greater volume of diplomatic traffic between the UK and the EU going forward. Doing more business with Brussels inevitably means doing more talking. In that regard, today is just the beginning. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. Some goods will be allowed ""to flow freely again"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said. The deal will enable staff to be recruited to work in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Copyright 2025 BBC.

81766,Israel lets aid into Gaza after 11-week blockade but UN calls it 'drop in ocean',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d4kz8p00eo,"Israel says it has allowed five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid, including baby food, into the Gaza Strip after 11 weeks of blockade. The UN's humanitarian chief welcomed the move but stressed it was only ""a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"" by the 2.1 million Palestinians in the war-torn territory, where global experts are warning of a looming famine. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to temporarily let in a ""minimal"" amount of food followed pressure from allies in the US Senate. ""We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he stressed in a video in response to criticism of the move in Israel. Netanyahu said food deliveries would continue only until the Israeli military and private companies had set up hubs to distribute aid under a US-backed plan rejected by the UN. He also declared that Israeli forces would ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza as part of the expanded ground offensive against Hamas that the Israeli military began on Sunday. Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people across the territory on Monday, according to first responders and hospitals. One strike reportedly killed five people at a school being used as a shelter for displaced families in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza. The Israeli military said it struck ""Hamas terrorists"" who were operating inside a command-and-control centre in the area. It also ordered the evacuation of the southern city of Khan Younis and its eastern suburbs, warning residents that it was about to launch an ""unprecedented attack"" there. Israel stopped all deliveries of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the hostages still held in Gaza. The resumed Israeli bombardment and ground operation have reportedly killed more than 3,000 people and displaced 400,000 others, while the UN says the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel. Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned half a million people faced starvation. The UN said Israel was obliged under international humanitarian law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israeli officials said there was no shortage of aid because thousands of lorry loads had gone into Gaza during the ceasefire. They accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group denied. But after pressure from Israel's allies increased, the Israeli prime minister's office announced on Sunday night it would ""allow a basic quantity of food to be brought in for the population in order to make certain that no starvation crisis develops in the Gaza Strip"". Israeli right-wing politicians and activists were quick to assail the abrupt policy change. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called it ""a grave mistake"" that would ""fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels"". In a video posted on social media on Monday in response to the criticism, Netanyahu did not make humanitarian arguments when he explained the decision to let in some food. ""Since the beginning of the war, we said that in order to achieve victory - to defeat Hamas and to free all our hostages, two missions that are intertwined - there is one necessary condition: We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he said. He said he had blocked aid deliveries via the UN and other humanitarian organisations because of looting by Hamas, and he was now pursuing a ""different method"" involving a US-backed non-governmental organisation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, distributing aid from hubs protected by security contractors and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). However, he warned a ""red line"" was now approaching and ""our best friends in the world, [US] senators whom I know as passionate supporters of Israel"", had voiced concerns. ""They come to me and say this: 'We're giving you all the support to achieve victory... But there's one thing we cannot accept. We cannot handle images of starvation'."" ""And so, in order to achieve victory, we must somehow solve this problem. Until we establish those distribution points, and until we build a sterile area under IDF control for distributing food and medicine, we need to provide a minimal, basic bridge - just enough to prevent hunger,"" he added. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right leader, sought to smooth over the decision by urging the Israeli public to focus on the big picture. Smotrich - who advocates building new Israeli settlements in Gaza - said the military offensive was meant to force Palestinians to the south of the territory ""and from there, with God's help, to third countries"", permanently displacing them. On Monday, Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada, said the decision to allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza was ""wholly inadequate"". In a joint statement, they said: ""If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response."" On Monday evening, Israeli military body Cogat announced five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid, including food for babies, had entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing ""following the recommendation of professional IDF officials and in accordance with the directive of the political echelon"". The UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, said it was a ""welcome development"" that Israeli authorities had allowed it to resume delivery of limited aid, and said nine of its trucks had been cleared to enter via the Kerem Shalom crossing. ""But it is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed, and significantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza, starting tomorrow morning,"" he warned. He also said Israel had reassured the UN its work would be facilitated through existing mechanisms and that he was ""determined that our aid reach those in greatest need, and that the risk of theft by Hamas or other armed groups is minimised"". UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said none of the aid had been picked up at the designated zone inside Gaza because it was ""already dark"" and due to ""security concerns, we cannot operate in those conditions"", according to the AFP news agency. The director general of the Israeli foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, earlier told reporters that ""in the coming days, Israel will facilitate the entry of dozens of aid trucks"". A senior Israeli official meanwhile said preparations for the aid plan mentioned by Netanyahu would be completed in about a week - a claim that was questioned by the head of the US-based charity World Central Kitchen. ""This is not true. Will take weeks,"" chef José Andrés wrote on X. ""This plan will leave Palestinians hungry. The new humanitarian foundation members should be ashamed of themselves… We already have a system in place to feed all Palestinians with the help of Palestinians."" UN and other aid agencies have said they have about 8,900 lorry loads of humanitarian aid already in position and ready to enter Gaza, as well as what Fletcher described as ""clear, principled and practical plan to save lives at scale"" and reduce looting. They have also insisted they will not co-operate with the Israeli-US plan to distribute aid from hubs located mostly in the south of Gaza, saying it contradicts their fundamental humanitarian principles of impartiality, independence and neutrality. They have warned it will practically exclude those with mobility issues, including those with disabilities and the elderly, force further displacement, expose thousands of people to harm, make aid conditional on political and military aims, and set an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery around the world. A displaced Palestinian man living in the coastal al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis with his wife and two children, aged nine and two, said they were currently able to eat one meal a day thanks to ""significant rationing"". ""Getting access to food, medicine and hygiene products has become extremely difficult - almost impossible - due to the shortage of these items and their high prices if they are available,"" Abd al-Fatah Hussein told the BBC in a message. Mohammed Abu Rijleh meanwhile said his charity, Shabab Gaza (Gaza Youth), had been able to distribute only around 2,500 meals on Monday - far fewer than usual. He told the BBC by telephone it had been a struggle to find ingredients to cook, forcing him to buy them at high prices from local markets. Netanyahu also said Israeli forces were engaged in ""massive fighting"" in Gaza and were making progress. ""We are going to take control of all areas of the Strip, that's what we're going to do,"" he said. He said the ""main objective"" of the expanded offensive was to defeat Hamas and that it would lead to the release of the 58 remaining hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. On Sunday, IDF spokesman Brig Gen Effie Defrin said five divisions were involved in an operation that would include ""dividing the territory and distancing the population for its safety"". ""The only thing that can stop us is the return of our hostages,"" he added. While negotiators for Israel and Hamas remain in Qatar, both sides say there has been no breakthrough in a new round of indirect talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry. A new round of talks has taken place in Doha after Israel carried out airstrikes which killed hundreds. The BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how world leaders are responding to Israel's blockade of Gaza. After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'. The BBC speaks to people in Gaza during a 10-week blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid. It marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in March.

815434,Huge challenges await new president of divided Romania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3jxp72mv2o,"Imagine having a president called Nicky. That's what Romanians just voted for: a softly-spoken, slightly geeky mathematician who everyone refers to by his first name, Nicusor – or Nicky. On Monday, hours after claiming victory in the elections, the new president picked up his daughter from school as usual. He's promised his children nothing will change. But for Romania things looked very different this morning. Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades. But it was also the least extreme option for change. Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults. He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania. Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over. ""This time, fear managed to defeat fury,"" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout. ""Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards. ""It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power."" I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days. When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags. They tended to talk about God and the ""traditional values"" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU ""imposing"" same-sex marriage on Romania. Other voters are drawn to Simion's ""Romania first"" rhetoric and promises of a better life. ""Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,"" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples. She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be ""so corrupt"". So when the results came in she was disappointed. ""I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?"" Liliana shrugged. ""I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan."" George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a ""man of my people"". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes. Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections. Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having ""dictatorial tendencies"" and said the country was run by ""the ayatollahs"". ""It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,"" Diana thinks. ""It made me change my vote."" Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him ""autistic, poor guy"". ""Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,"" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote. ""I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that."" For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling. At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: ""Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!"" They were referring to evidence Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu. When he came from nowhere to win the first round,the vote was annulled. This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day. But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia – he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin – was a turn-off for many voters. Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion. His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe. When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement. Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won. ""So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,"" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. ""I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU."" By contrast, Dan put relations with Europe at the heart of his campaign. ""It's better for the European way, for younger people and for Romania – because we get more EU funds, more development,"" another young voter, Petrosanu, approved. ""Also Nicusor is the smartest guy since the revolution. He knows how to do things."" In the end, Dan's win was emphatic. But millions of Romanian voters chose a different way, different values. While hopes for the 'change' candidate are high, the challenges are huge and patience may be limited. ""In my view, this is the last chance for the mainstream political class to win an election on a 'Save Europe, Save Democracy' platform,"" Radu Magdin warns. George Simion is just 38 and going nowhere; his nationalist AUR party are strong in parliament. ""Next time, it's 'bye bye' if these people do not do their job,"" the analyst says. ""Next time it could be somebody like Simion."" A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning. Some goods will be allowed ""to flow freely again"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

1089499,BBC uncovers child sex abuse in South Africa's illegal mines,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74z0px07nzo,"This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing. The most shocking thing for Jonathan, who had endured six gruelling months living and working underground in an abandoned South African gold mine, was the abuse he witnessed being meted out to children. Some are recruited for cheap labour, but others are brought in specifically for sex, campaigners say. Jonathan, now in his late 20s, had migrated to South Africa from a nearby country on the promise of making easy money working in one of its dozens of disused mines, closed by multinationals because they were no longer commercially viable. We are protecting his full identity as he fears reprisals from the vicious criminal gangs that run the illegal mining industry for speaking to the media. Details of what the young people were going though emerged after the death of dozens of illegal miners near the town of Stilfontein late last year when the mine was blockaded by police. In a calm and steady voice, Jonathan describes the heat, long hours and limited food and sleeping options which took a toll on his body. But an enduring memory is what happened to the underage miners in the shaft where he worked. ""I used to see these kids in the mine - teenagers actually, 15, 17-year-olds. ""Others used to take advantage of them sometimes. It was a little bit scary, and I wasn't comfortable with it."" He said they were raped by adult miners who promised to give them some of the gold they found in exchange for sex. ""If that kid is desperate for money, he will take the risk."" Jonathan describes how the children would approach teams of miners for protection but ""that team would have conditions"". Sex was also used as punishment if the teenagers failed to complete a task for their team. Jonathan says the children in the mine where he worked were all foreign and did not realise what they were getting themselves into. Mining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up. He says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa. Many of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry. ""Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa… It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,"" Mr Sefuli says. The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working. Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground. ""In some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground."" He adds that the abuse deeply affected the children. ""They change their behaviour patterns and have trust issues. They don't want you to get close to them, because they feel that they can no longer trust anyone."" South Africa's illegal mining industry made global headlines last year following a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, near the town of Stilfontein in the North West Province. The authorities had been trying to curb illegal mining, which the government said cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (£2.6bn) in lost revenue last year. They launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs. As part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, ""smoke out"" the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested. Soon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men. Among those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate. Through this, the Department of Social Development (DSD) confirmed that 31 of the rescued Stilfontein miners were found to be children. They were all Mozambicans nationals and in November, 27 of them were repatriated. Save the Children South Africa helped translate some of the interviews between the underage miners and the rescue workers. ""They went through trauma, because some of them also saw others being sexually exploited,"" the charity's CEO Gugu Xaba tells the BBC. ""Just the feeling that they may not come out of there destroyed those children mentally. ""The adult miners would start by grooming them, by acting like they like them."" She says the children were then made to perform sexual acts on the adults and they were then raped, days after day. ""You find that the adult will have three or four of them that they are doing the same thing to.""  Ms Xaba says mining gangs recruit children because they are easier to manipulate and cheaper. ""Children don't understand when you say: 'I'll pay you 20 rands ($1; £0.80) per day.' The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So it's easier to use a child to do the work. It's easier to take a child who's kind of voiceless and to bring them down there."" Beyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex. Many illegal miners spend months underground, rarely going up to the surface. Markets spring up underground to provide them with anything they need. ""Most children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And you've got a pimp who is taking the money, and it means every day this child is used as a commercial sex worker."" The BBC asked the police and the DSD whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations. They did not respond to our requests. A source working on the Stilfontein miners' cases said many of the children did not want to testify. Meanwhile, the illegal mining industry continues to thrive. And with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore, it is a business that is unlikely to end anytime soon, leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk.

1064265,Iran and Britain summon envoys over alleged spying in UK,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw7znqvl77o,"Britain and Iran have summoned each other's envoys after three Iranians were charged with spying in the UK. Three Iranian men were arrested on 3 May and appeared in court in London on Saturday on charges of spying for the Islamic republic. Iran's IRNA news agency said the British charge d'affaire was asked on Sunday to give an explanation for what it said was ""unjustified"" and ""politically motivated"" arrests. The UK Foreign Office then responded on Monday by summoning Tehran's ambassador to the UK. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the UK would ""not tolerate growing state-backed threats on UK soil"". ""I can confirm the Iranian ambassador has been summoned and [Foreign Secretary David Lammy] is raising with Iranian foreign minister in the strongest terms that the UK will not accept any Iranian state threat activity in the UK,"" she said in Parliament on Monday. She added that the government would draft new powers of proscription to cover state threats. She said they would create a power ""stronger than current National Security Act powers in allowing us to restrict the activity and operations of foreign state-backed organisations in the UK."" The Foreign Office said the government ""is clear that protecting national security remains our top priority and Iran must be held accountable for its actions"". ""The [ambassador] summons follows this weekend's announcement which stated that three Iranian nationals had been charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service,"" it added. The alleged spying took place from August 2024 to February 2025, according to the Metropolitan Police. Police have identified the suspects as Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, all living in London. A fourth man had been arrested on 9 May as part of the investigation, but was released without charge, the Met said. The three men who were charged had arrived in the UK between 2016 and 2022 were granted temporary leave to remain after claiming asylum. It is alleged they carried out surveillance with a view to locating journalists associated with Iran International, which produces coverage that is critical of the current regime in Iran. It has been proscribed in Iran as a terrorist organisation. Home Secretary Cooper said the charges against the Iranian nationals came alongside a ""series of grave wider issues"", including ""rising numbers of Iran-linked operations on UK soil"" and a ""nearly 50% in a year"" increase in MI5 state threats investigations. ""The Iranian regime poses an unacceptable threat to our domestic security which cannot continue,"" she said. Five other Iranian men were also arrested on 5 May in London, Swindon, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester as part of a separate counter-terrorism investigation. Four of the men - who had been held on suspicion of preparation of a terrorist act - had been released from custody, although the investigation ""remains active and is ongoing"", police said. The fifth man was earlier bailed to an unspecified date in May. Copyright 2025 BBC.

267067,Indian YouTuber arrested for allegedly 'spying' for Pakistan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e7xv8v80o,"Police in India have arrested a local YouTuber on suspicions of spying for Pakistan. Jyoti Malhotra, a travel influencer from the northern Indian state of Haryana, allegedly travelled to the neighbouring country several times - her last trip was in March 2025. Police in Haryanaallegethat she was in touch with a Pakistan High Commission official, who was expelled from India earlier this month. The YouTuber's father has denied allegations that she was a spy, saying she went to Pakistan after acquiring necessary permissions. Ms Malhotra describes herself on social media as a ""modern girl with old ideas"", and has 377,000 subscribers on YouTube and 133,000 followers on Instagram. But officers have questioned how she financed her travel around the globe, with her videos documenting visits to places like  Bangladesh, China, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. She has also visited several Indian destinations and religious places. Police say it defies her known source of income. Police claim Ms Malhotra was in touch with ""Pakistani intelligence operatives"" and hadcontinuous contact with a Pakistani citizen. Ms Malhotra is also being investigated for any links with the Pahalgam attack, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the superintendent of police in Haryana's Hisar district, told ANI news agency. They say they have leads on others who may have collaborated with the influencer, who does not have direct access to any military or defence information. ""She was in touch with other YouTube influencers... She used to go to Pakistan on sponsored trips,"" Mr Sawan added. Her arrest comes after the Indian governmentaskedAhsan-ur-Rahim, the Pakistan High Commission official with whom the YouTuber was alleged to have been in contact, to leave the country on 13 May, alleging he had indulged in activities ""not in keeping with his official status in India"". Pakistan also asked an Indian embassy staff member in Islamabad to leave for indulging in activities ""incompatible"" with his privileged status. According to a complaint registered by the police, Ms Malhotra met Ahsan-ur-Rahim for the first time in 2023 when she had visited the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, seeking a visa to visit the neighbouring country. Her last video on Pakistan was uploaded in March, in which she was seen in the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi attending a Ramadan dinner. In other videos from Pakistan, she is seen visiting Hindu and Sikh temples, famous local markets, and interacting with locals. Arrests in India and Pakistan over allegations of spying are not uncommon. Ms Malhotra's arrest comes following days of military tensions between the neighbours earlier this month. On 7 May, India struck what it calls ""terror infrastructure"" inside Pakistan, days after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam, a picturesque valley in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.

698158,Will Romania vote take country away from European mainstream?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7z2p743x4o,"When Romania's presidential election was annulled late last year after claims of Russian interference, a far-right conspiracy theorist was blocked from the top job. Many Romanians were deeply relieved; many others were angry their votes had been stolen. But six months later, with the country back at the ballot box, another hard-right Euro-sceptic is in the running for president. George Simion won the first round of the new elections on 4 May by a large margin. Now the former football casual turned nationalist politician is facing off against Nicusor Dan, the liberal mayor of Bucharest. It's a vote that could see Romania, a member of both Nato and the European Union (EU), take a sharp turn away from the European mainstream. Both candidates cast their votes on Sunday morning, with Simion saying he had voted for the future ""that should be decided only by Romanians, for Romanians and for Romania"". Dan told reporters he was voting for ""collaboration with our European partners and not for [the] isolation of Romania"". The polls have been too close to call. Teleorman county is one of Romania's poorest areas and has been solidly social-democrat territory for many years. But earlier this month, 57% of voters here chose Simion for president in the first round of voting. A couple of hours' drive south-west from Bucharest, entry to the region is announced in blue letters on a rusty metal arch over the main road. The streets are lined with wild poppies, not campaign posters for the candidates. There's no obvious sign of the elections. But social media feeds on people's phones are full of political content. The latest clip to go viral features a folk fantasy world of embroidered tops, prayers and bears and has the slogan ""I choose Romania"". ""It was an anti-system, anti-mainstream vote,"" is how Felicia Alexandru of Aperio Intelligence explains the nationwide surge of support for the far-right candidate in the first round. After more than three decades of the same parties dominating politics, frustration with corruption and poor performance has been building. ""People are so unhappy with what happened in high level politics, this is a vote against that,"" Felicia says. The protest vote is not confined to the poorest or most disaffected. The Comalat dairy firm is unrecognisable from the business Petre Filip launched 25 years ago. Back then, he would set out at 05:00 every day in his Dacia to drive round farms buying up milk. Then, each evening, he hand-delivered the cheese and yoghurt produced by his three workers to clients. His old packaging machine now stands in the lobby as a reminder of the early days. But Petre has since been granted €1.5m (£1.3m; $1.7m) in EU funding to modernise and expand his business. It's money he never has to pay back. ""That was a really, really good thing for us,"" the businessman enthuses, showing off a production line of glistening metal machines in several rooms. He employs more than 50 staff. ""I like George Simion,"" staff member Mihaela announces with a smile, while squeezing liquid from big clumps of curd cheese. She shrugs when I mention the fear in Brussels that he would make EU-Romania relations very turbulent. ""He's on the side of Romanians. He's for the people. To create jobs and better lives,"" Mihaela replies. Simion talks a lot about ""making Romania great again"", echoing the MAGA politicians in the US he so admires. He has the same isolationist approach, too: Romania first, in everything. When pushed, he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal for his invasion of Ukraine. But like Donald Trump, he has also pledged to end military aid to Kyiv and he's left the future of Ukraine's vital grain exports via Romania unclear. Simion has been banned from Ukraine and Moldova for calling for territory there to be part of Romania. In his latest outbursts this week, he called his election opponent ""autistic, poor guy"". He also accused French President Emmanuel Macron of having ""dictatorial tendencies"". Mr Filip says Simion is ""far too impulsive"" to be president, driven ""by hormones not his brain"". But he is so disillusioned by the whole scene he's inclined not to vote at all. Just up the road in Roșiori de Vede, they are discussing the elections too - and fretting. Roxana runs a factory making work uniforms, including for the military in another EU country. Her clients have been calling wondering whether Romania is about to vote for a ""pro-Russian"" president. ""They want to know whether their orders are safe!"" she laughs. Roxana herself plans to vote for the man people here refer to by his first name, Nicusor, because she likes how he's managed Bucharest as mayor. She's also deeply disturbed by what she calls Simion's ""hooligan"" behaviour. ""It's such a bad image for Romania in Europe. I am ashamed,"" Roxana says, recalling the candidate's insults about Macron this week. In another recent incident, Simion threatened to sexually assault a female MP, calling her a pig. ""Compare that with a person who won the International Mathematics Olympiad,"" Roxana says, referring to a competition Dan won in the 1980s. He went on to get a doctorate from the Sorbonne. Ahead of the second-round vote, Roxana and her friend Andrea have been involved in a grassroots initiative to persuade voters to back Dan. ""I've tried to say why Simion's plan is unfeasible but I don't think I've been super successful,"" Andrea admits, and says she's ""very worried"". ""I see what people are saying online and they really believe in Simion and think he's going to shake everything up and take down the system. ""They think it's all bad, but it's not."" Her own candidate, Dan, is emphatically pro-EU and pro-Nato, and his campaign slogan is ""honesty"". ""I don't promise miracles,"" is his modest election pledge. ""But I promise I will fight."" If that fight fails, and Simion wins, he won't be the only hard-right candidate at the forefront of Romanian politics. Much of his support comes from those who originally voted for Calin Georgescu, the fringe figure who won the first election in November before it was cancelled on national security grounds. The two men have often appeared side-by-side since then - including when they voted today - and Simion has pledged to make Georgescu prime minister if he is elected. It's unclear how that could work, given that he was accused of benefiting from ""massive"" and ""aggressive"" meddling by Moscow. ""If Simion wins then there will be chaos in politics from Monday,"" Roxana predicts, including for the economy. ""The question is whether he stays in the shadow of Georgescu, or completely changes perspective,"" Felicia agrees. ""Is this a campaign strategy, or what he believes in?"" A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning.

751744,Who are the winners and losers from the UK-EU agreement?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz63d82z785o,"A deal to ""reset"" relations between the UK and the EU following Brexit has been agreed at a summit in London. The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU. BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers. Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU – including food products – have faced new checks and extra paperwork. Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules. UK food exports to the EU have fallen– with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 – and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape. Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers. If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats. Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023were worth £14bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales. But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards – a system known as ""dynamic alignment"" – and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area. The UK will be also required to make a financial contribution. However is it currently unknown how much the payment would be and when it would be required. Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy -just 0.04% of GDP in 2024- it is politically sensitive. The ""reset"" document notes ""political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038"" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected. Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets. Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: ""This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement."" She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be ""no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters"" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products. In 2023, the UKexported £1.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports. Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would ""speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market"". Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30. However, the impact of what is being called a ""youth experience scheme"" could be uneven. Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way. And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. ""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,"" she said. Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer. The government claims: ""British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control."" However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the ""potential use of eGates where appropriate"". It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify. Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October. EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders. Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says. Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with €150bn (£126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm. This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK. The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directlyemploys about164,00 peoplein the UK. Between 2020 and 2024, the UK wasestimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Instituteto have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter. Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning. Some goods will be allowed ""to flow freely again"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said. The deal will enable staff to be recruited to work in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Copyright 2025 BBC.

1021873,Defiant Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu appears in court,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2rw7zp7no,"Tanzania's main opposition leader Tundu Lissu has appeared in court for the first time since his arrest on treason charges last month, telling his supporters not to fear. He raised his fist in a gesture of defiance and told his supporters: ""You will be fine. You should not fear."" Tension was high in the country's biggest city, Dar es Salaam, in the morning, with security officers heavily deployed at the trial magistrate's court and elsewhere. But that did not deter his supporters, hundreds of whom gathered outside the court. The court had previously attempted to conduct hearings virtually, but he and his legal team opposed this, citing the need for transparency and due process. The Chadema party leader was arrested on 9 April following his rallying call for ""no reforms, no election"" - telling supporters that the general election due in October should not go ahead unless there are electoral reforms. He has since been charged with treason and publishing false information online, which allegedly incited rebellion and accused police of electoral misconduct. He denies the charges. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. On Monday, the prosecution said that investigations into the treason charges were still ongoing, with Lissu's lawyers questioning the delay. The court has urged the prosecution to hasten the process and the case will be heard again on 2 June. Lissu's team also raised concerns over the heavy police presence around the court, which the judges acknowledged, saying there would be consultations on whether this was justified. The case, which Lissu has described as politically motivated, has heightened concerns over the state of democracy in the country. It has attracted global attention, especially after the deportation of prominent Kenyan personalities who had travelled to the country in solidarity with Lissu. On Sunday, former Justice Minister Martha Karua said she had been deported from Tanzania along with her two colleagues to prevent them from attending the trial. The Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition said it was shocked by the ""arbitrary arrests"". Hours later, former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and other prominent rights activists said they had been stopped and held at the airport. Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has apparently backed the moves by the security agencies, saying: ""We've started seeing a trend where some activists from our neighbouring countries are trying to interfere with our internal affairs. ""If they have been contained in their country, let them not come here to meddle. Let's not give them a chance - they have already created chaos in their own country. ""We are the only country [in the region] that still has security and peace. ""I urge our security agencies... not to give a chance to indisciplined people from elsewhere to come create indiscipline here."" Another former Kenyan chief justice, David Maraga, was in court and said that he hoped ""the legal process ahead will be fair, just, and expeditious"". Recent events in Tanzania, including the arrest of other opposition figures and a wave of abductions and killing targeting government critics, have sparked condemnation and calls for an end to political repression. The Chadema party has been disqualified from the October general elections after demanding electoral reforms and refusing to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.

575153,France to open high-security prison in Amazon jungle,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7n81emy3o,"France will build a new high-security prison in its overseas territory of French Guiana to house drug traffickers and radical Islamists, the country's justice minister announced during a visit to the territory. Gérald Darmanin told Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper that the prison would target organised crime ""at all levels"" of the drug supply chain. The €400m (£337m) facility, which could open as early as 2028, will be built in an isolated location deep in the Amazon jungle in the northwestern region of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. The plan was announced after a series of violent incidents linked to criminal gangs whichsaw prisons and staff targeted across France in recent months. The prison will hold up to 500 people, with a separate wing designed to house the most dangerous criminals. In an interview with JDD, the minister said the new prison would be governed by an ""extremely strict carceral regime"" designed to ""incapacitate the most dangerous drug traffickers"". Darmanin said the facility would be used to detain people ""at the beginning of the drug trail"", as well as serving as a ""lasting means of removing the heads of the drug trafficking networks"" in mainland France. French Guiana is a region of France on the north-east coast of South America. Its residents are eligible to vote in French elections and have access to the French social security system, as well as other subsidies. Its distance from the French mainland means drug lords ""will no longer be able to have any contact with their criminal networks"", Darmanin told JDD. French authorities have long struggled to control the infiltration of mobile phones into the prison network. Tens of thousands are known tocirculate through French jails. Earlier this year, the French government announced new legislation designed to crack down on the activity of criminal gangs. The measures will create a dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office to deal with organised crime. It will also introduce extra powers for investigators, and a special protected status for informers. It will also see the creation of new high-security prisons - including the facility in French Guiana - to hold the most powerful drugs barons, with stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world. France has seen a series of attacks on prisons in recent months, which Darmanin has described as ""terrorist"" incidents that come in response to the government's new legislation. The perpetrators of these attacks haveset vehicles outside prisons alight, while Toulon's La Farlede prison was hit by gunfire. In some incidents the perpetrators of these attacks have styled themselves as defenders of prisoners' rights. The proposed new facility in French Guiana is to be built at a ""strategic crossroads"" for drugs mules, particularly from Brazil and Suriname, according to AFP news agency. Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni is the former port of entry to the infamous Devil's Island penal colony, where 70,000 convicts from mainland France were sent between 1852 and 1954. The penal colony was the setting of French writer Henri Charrière's book Papillon, which was later made into a Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. The BBC has contacted the French justice ministry for comment. A masked gang tried to abduct the woman and her young son in the latest gang attack in France. The French actor, who denies the allegations, has been given a suspended jail term of 18 months. Capt Ibrahim Traoré, 37, is portraying himself as a champion of pan-Africanism. The 81-year-old man said he had no choice but to shoot the animal after it attacked him during a hunt.

364513,"Cancer touches us all, says Biden after outpouring of support",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvmq997y9go,"Joe Biden expressed his gratitude for the words of support that have poured in from across the world, including a private letter from Britain's King Charles, after the former US president announced his cancer diagnosis on Sunday. ""Cancer touches us all,"" Biden wrote on social media on Monday morning. ""Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support."" On Sunday, Biden's office disclosed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The news comes as fresh questions are being raised about the former president's health while he was in office. ""On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,"" Biden's office said in a statement. ""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management."" A Gleason score of nine means his illness is classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. Questions have been raised about how long he might have had this cancer for and if the disease was affecting him while he was still in office. Biden said his diagnosis was made on Friday after he reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. In the wake of the cancer diagnosis, many have offered Biden their support including President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris. King Charles has written privately to  Biden offering his support and best wishes, Buckingham Palace said. The king, 76, who has met Biden a number of times, is also receiving treatment for an unspecified type of cancer after his diagnosis in 2024. Biden had then sent his best wishes, saying: ""I'm concerned about him. Just heard about his diagnosis. I'll be talking to him, God willing."" Vice-President JD Vance offered well wishes, but questioned whether the American people had a clear picture of Biden's health while the former president was in office. ""We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,"" Vance said on Monday.  ""And that's that's … you can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with a recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers around the former president, I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people."" Vance also said he blamed the people around him more than Biden himself. ""This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,"" he added. The announcement comes as Biden staves off criticism from a forthcoming book that claims he and his advisers hid his deteriorating health while he was in the White House. Details revealed last week from the book entitled, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, include Biden not recognising actor and frequent Democratic donor George Clooney at a fundraiser last year and aides discussing putting the former president in a wheelchair. The book will be released on Tuesday. Nearly a year ago, the former president was forced to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election because of concerns about his health and age. The disease has spread to the 82-year-old's bones but his office said the cancer could be effectively managed. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men in the US. Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has defined himself by his persistence and endurance. Recordings of the then-president's interviews with special counsel reveal he struggled to recall key details from his life. Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential campaign was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. Copyright 2025 BBC.

439895,"Four sticking points in Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jxn8m88ro,"US President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is one step closer to a full vote in the House of Representatives. The 1,116-page bill - officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - was approved 17-16 by the budget committee on Sunday night. Four Republican dissidents voted ""present"" rather than against the legislation, giving House Speaker Mike Johnson a rare win. The hold-outs last week voted 'no' to the bill, citing concerns that its spending cuts were not deep enough to reduce the national debt. The Senate must also pass the legislation and Republicans in that chamber are planning their own tweaks. Let's take a look at where the disagreements lie. Among the primary sticking points in the negotiations is just how much to slash from the bill. As things stand, the measure's tax breaks total about $4.9tr (£3.7tn), partly paid for by cuts to the healthcare programme known as Medicaid, as well as to green energy tax breaks approved by former President Joe Biden. Four right-wing lawmakers withheld their support, arguing that the cuts should be steeper to avoid swelling America's public debt, which currently stands at $36tr. A fifth lawmaker also voted no, citing procedural reasons. ""The bill does not yet meet the moment,""  one of the rebels, Texas Republican Chip Roy, posted on social media late on Sunday. ""We can and must do better before we pass the final product."" Perhaps the most contentious item in the bill are cuts - partly through work requirements - to Medicaid, a healthcare programme aimed at lower-income Americans. Roy and other Republicans - including South Carolina's Ralph Norman, Oklahoma's Josh Brecheen and Georgia's Andrew Clyde - want further cuts to Medicaid and other social security programmes. On Sunday night, Speaker Johnson said ""minor modifications"" had been promised to the four rebels. Norman said these concessions include making the Medicaid work requirements take effect sooner, preventing undocumented immigrants from accessing Medicaid and ditching green energy tax credits. The bill currently would require that states deny Medicaid coverage if able-bodied Americans using the programme are not working at least 80 hours a month or undertaking other community options - from 2029, after Trump has left office. It would also end coverage for those who cannot show they are meeting work requirements. Roy and other conservatives want those work requirements to start straightaway - rather than after President Trump has left office. Other lawmakers, such as Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley, have argued against any cuts to Medicaid, warning it would affect millions of lower-income constituents. Hawley wrote in the New York Times that such a move would be ""both morally wrong and politically suicidal"". Dozens of other House Republicans have also voiced concerns. Another point of contention in the bill is a tripling of a local tax deduction - known as Salt - from $10,000 to $30,000 for couples. Some lawmakers from states with high taxes such as New York, California and New Jersey have objected, saying that the proposed cap is not high enough. In a joint statement earlier in May, New York Republican Congress members Elise Stefanik, Andrew Garbarino, Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler said Speaker Johnson's offer was too low and "" insulting"". Some so-called Salt Republicans want the cap raised to $62,000 for individuals and double for couples filing jointly. House Republican leaders are reportedly seeking a compromise that would see the cap raised to $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for joint filers. The ""Salt Caucus"" formed in 2021 is a bipartisan effort that brings together both Democrats and Republicans who hope to repeal the current $10,000 cap. As part of the bill, House Republicans have called for substantial reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, or Snap. More than 42 million Americans currently benefit from the Snap programme, which allows them to use federal funds to buy groceries every year. The legislation would require individual states to shoulder 5% of the benefit's costs each year, as well as 75% of the administrative costs. At the moment, states are not responsible for Snap costs and pay half of the administrative costs. Republicans also hope to expand existing work requirements for recipients, which currently apply to people without dependants between the ages of 18 and 54. The current proposal would expand that to 64. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said the proposal ""is a slap in the face"" to millions of Americans ""who rely on food assistance programme to put food on the table and make sure their kids don't go hungry"". Republicans argue the proposal would reduce government waste, promote work over welfare, and restore ""common sense"" to the programme. The House Agriculture Committee has already approved $300m in cuts to the Snap programme to fund tax cuts. Government data shows that about 12% of Americans received Snap benefits last year, with the figure higher in some Republican-leaning states such as Alabama and Oklahoma. América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died when the tall ship lost power and drifted into the bridge.

832524,Israel orders Khan Younis evacuation ahead of 'unprecedented attack',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrqg6j4y8o,"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has ordered residents of Khan Younis to evacuate as it prepares to launch an ""unprecedented attack"". People were ordered to move towards al-Mawasi in the west of the strip, in one of the largest evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military in recent months. An Arabic statement shared by IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the area ""will be considered a dangerous combat zone"", adding: ""Terrorist organizations have brought you disaster. For your safety, evacuate immediately."" The IDF launched a major new Gaza offensive on Friday named Operation Gideon's Chariots. Hospitals have said more than 100 people have been killed in the last 24 hours. One woman from Khan Younis told the BBC that the new evacuation order - which also covers the areas of Bani Suhaila and Abasan - was her ""worst nightmare"". Among those who fled was Tasneem Barakeh, 13, who said the order was issued while her father was out searching for food and that they were forced to leave without him. ""Please God, let the war stop. Where is my father?"" she said. ""We don't know where he is. Please, just bring us my father."" Abdallah Abu Shab, who also fled, said: ""They told us to go to Al-Mawasi, and here we are. What do we do?"" ""There is no tent for us there or anything,"" he said, adding ""there isn't any transportation and people do not have money to ride a cart"". Another woman, who is already living under an evacuation order in central Gaza, said she would not move ""because there is no place to go"". The IDF said the aim of its attack was to ""destroy the capabilities of terrorist organizations in this area"". Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would ""take control"" of the whole of Gaza. In a video posted on social media, he said: ""We are engaged in massive fighting - intense and substantial - and there is progress. ""We are going to take control of all areas of the Strip, that's what we're going to do."" The IDF said it had struck 160 targets across Gaza in the last 24 hours, including anti-tank positions, underground infrastructure and a weapons storage point. One of the strikes killed seven at a school housing displaced families in Nuseirat, central Gaza, and three in a house in nearby Deir Al-Balah, the territory's Hamas-run health authority said. Overnight, a warehouse containing medical supplies at the Nasser Hospital was hit by an Israeli strike, local Hamas-run health authorities reported. British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said the strike happened ""as Palestinians who were killed and wounded from other attacks were being brought to the hospital"". ""We are just seeing all our work being burned to ashes,"" a spokesman for the charity said. Separately, Palestinian media reported that Israeli special forces troops dressed in women's clothing had entered a Khan Younis home undercover and killed one man on Monday morning, before arresting his wife and child. Israeli media named him as Ahmad Sarhan, and reported he was a senior member of the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees - a Palestinian militant group allied with Hamas. The IDF has previously said the expanded Gaza operations are aimed at ""achieving all the war's objectives"", including releasing hostages and ""the defeat of Hamas"". But a group representing many of the hostage's families said the operation posed ""grave and escalating dangers"" to hostages still held in Gaza. ""Testimonies from released hostages describe significantly worsened treatment following military strikes, including physical abuse, restraint and reduced food,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. On Sunday, Israel announced it would allow a ""basic amount of food"" to enter Gaza to ensure that ""no starvation crisis develops"" afterblockading the territory for 11 weeks. Netanyahu said the decision to allow a ""minimal"" amount of food into Gazafollowed pressure from allies in the US Senate. ""We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he stressed in a video responding to criticism within Israel of the humanitarian situation. The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage. Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh A new round of talks has taken place in Doha after Israel carried out airstrikes which killed hundreds. The BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how world leaders are responding to Israel's blockade of Gaza.

42828,Third man arrested over fires at homes linked to PM,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg78zw7yqyo,"A third man has been arrested over alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Sir Keir Starmer, the Met Police says. The 34-year-old was arrested on Monday morning in Chelsea, south-west London on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, the force said. His arrest follows that of two other men in connection with the fires. They relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address where he previously lived in north-west London. On Saturday, a 26-year-old man was arrested at Luton Airport on suspicion of the same offence. A third man, Roman Lavrynovych, 21, has already been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life. He appeared in court last Friday where he entered no pleas to the charges. The BBC understands that Mr Lavrynovych, a Ukrainian national, is a builder and roofer. He denied arson in a police interview. He has been remanded in custody until the next scheduled hearing at the Old Bailey on 6 June. Meanwhile, police have been given extra time to question the man who was arrested at Luton Airport. He remains in police custody and has not been named. There are three separate incidents being investigated in a probe led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command because of the connection with a high-profile public figure. Emergency services responded to a fire in the early hours of 12 May at the Kentish Town home where Sir Keir lived before he became prime minister and moved into 10 Downing Street. Damage was caused to the entrance of the property, which it is understood Sir Keir still owns and rents out, but nobody was hurt. Four days earlier, on 8 May, a car Sir Keir had sold to a neighbour in 2024 caught fire on the same street. The third fire took place on 11 May at the front door of a house converted into flats in Islington. The prime minister had previously lived there. Sir Keir thanked emergency services for their work following the fires, his official spokesman said on 12 May. He added that the PM could not make any further comments relating to a live investigation. The horticultural event welcomes royals, celebrities and dogs, showing rewilding and pet-friendly designs.

251929,DofE award 'gave me a reason to leave the house',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6287qdyeylo,"A woman who completed the gold Duke of Edinburgh's Award (DofE) said the scheme gave her a reason to leave the house. Charlotte Kemp, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was chosen to speak about her experience at Buckingham Palace. The 25-year-old said she decided to pursue the award while caring for her father, who had been diagnosed with dementia. She said the DofE scheme helped her when ""we don't have the luxury of choosing what challenges we face"". The organisers of the scheme said the event at Buckingham Palace was one of four festival-style celebrations of ""young people who have shown extraordinary perseverance, creativity and resilience"" to achieve their gold award. Sharing a stage with the Duke, Prince Edward, and celebrities including chef Jon Watts and comedian Bill Bailey, Ms Kemp said she had applied to do the DofE award just before she reached the age limit. Ms Kemp said: ""After I graduated from university, I was caring for my dad three evenings a week. ""I enjoyed this quality time, but I knew that if I wanted to take care of my dad the best way I could, I had to take care of myself first. ""I needed a community, a hobby, a reason to get out the house - a goal. I took another look at the DofE - given my age, I only had 21 months till I was deemed 'too old'. ""Not knowing what the future would look like for our family, I did it anyway."" Participants in the gold award scheme have to complete an expedition, and Ms Kemp completed both her practice and qualifying expeditions in Snowdonia at the same time. She said the blisters she got were a ""challenge"", but ""compared to caring for my dad, this felt like a holiday"". She also had to complete a volunteering activity, and she decided to set up a Squirrel Scout group. She says the four to six-year-olds who take part ""remind me to find joy in the little things"".

484676,Former Tory MP accused of harassing ex-wife,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3vqxp9nn3o,"A former Conservative MP will stand trial accused of harassment. Jamie Wallis, who is now known as Katie Wallis and uses female pronouns, represented Bridgend from 2019 to 2024. The 40-year-old from Butetown in Cardiff appeared at the city's magistrates' court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to harassing ex-wife Rebecca Wallis between 14 February and 21 March by making unwanted phone calls, sending unwanted messages and voice notes and driving past her home. No evidence was offered on a previous charge of stalking. Ms Wallis, who is the first MP to openly begin the process of gender transitioning, told the court: ""Legally I am known as Jamie, but I prefer to be known as Katie."" Simone Walsh, prosecuting, told the court the defendant and alleged victim were in a relationship for more than 15 years and separated in 2020, with their divorce finalised in 2024. ""Following the victim informing the defendant of a new relationship the defendant's behaviour became harassing in nature,"" she said. Narita Bahra, defending, said there was ""no malice"" on her client's part, adding she would be seeking a psychiatric report ahead of the trial. The case was postponed until 17 June. The refugees and asylum seekers charity is reunited with the food truck six weeks after it was taken.

609965,Princess Eugenie opens up about childhood back surgery,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln0wlklzko,"Princess Eugenie has said she ""couldn't get out of bed or do anything for myself"" while recovering after scoliosis surgery as a child. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, the King's niece opened up about her surgery, saying that she felt ""very embarrassed"" ahead of the operation and later struggled with the emotional impact of post-surgery care. Surgeons inserted titanium rods into her spine to correct a curvature caused by scoliosis when she was 12 years old and she spent 10 days on her back after the operation. She said that her mother, the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, helped her see the post-surgery scar on her back as a ""badge of honour"". Scoliosis is a condition where the spine twists and curves to the side. The cause of it is often unknown, and commonly starts in children aged between 10 and 15,according to the NHS. Eugenie was treated at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, in north London, and it was four months before she was able to return to school after it. ""I had a corner room in the hospital with two windows looking out over a car park,"" the 35-year-old said. ""I was too young to notice I couldn't get outside; all I cared about was where my parents and sister were. ""But I do remember watching someone waving to my incredible red-haired nurse through the window and having this feeling that I couldn't reach them,"" she said. ""I couldn't get out of bed or do anything for myself."" Speaking about how she felt ahead of the operation, she said she felt ""very embarrassed about the whole thing"". ""I remember being woken up really early before my surgery – I pulled my blanket over my head. I said: 'I don't want to see anyone and I don't want them to see me',"" she said. The operation left a visible scar on her back and she said her mother helped to ""train"" her brain to think that ""scars are cool"". ""She was amazing. She'd ask me if she could show it to people, then she'd turn me around and say, 'my daughter is superhuman, you've got to check out her scar',"" Eugenie said. ""All of sudden it was a badge of honour – a cool thing I had,"" she added. ""It became a positive memory, a part of me, that I could do something with in the future. I could help heal other people."" The princess's wedding dress in 2018 showed the scar at the top of her back and ahead of the wedding,she spoke of the importance of showing ""people your scars"". Speaking to ITV's This Morning at the time, she described it as a ""lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this"". ""I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it's really special to stand up for that,"" she added.

359016,Pet owners urged to be aware of travel checks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw72xg4rppo,"People planning to take their pets to Northern Ireland are being urged to be aware of new rules set to come into effect. From 4 June, routine checks on animal health certificates (AHC), which are issued by vets for each journey, will be carried out at ports in Belfast and Larne. The Isle of Man government said the changes were part of the implementation of the Brexit deal, which sets trading rules between the UK and the country. Minister for Environment, Food and Agriculture Clare Barber urged pet owners to ""plan ahead to avoid disruption or distress"" as the shift represented a ""significant change for pet owners"" . ""Please speak to your vet in good time, and check official guidance before you travel,"" she said. The requirement for the certificate remains unchanged, but the inspections are set to be introduced to align the island with other jurisdictions. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, which operates ferry services to Belfast, is working with the Manx government to make people aware of the changes. Pet owners travelling by ferry must report for the checks at a facility in Belfast upon arrival. To travel from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland pets must be microchipped and be vaccinated against rabies. They are required to enter via a recognised point of entry, and dogs must be treated for tapeworm. All pet owners must also be able to provide a valid AHC or EU Pet Passport. Scheduled commercial flights from the Isle of Man do not currently allow pets, but those travelling by private aircraft must follow the same rules.

488385,Energy price cap: What next for gas and electricity bills and can I fix?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd29v8mp9jo,"Gas and electricity bills are expected to fall in July, when a new price cap takes effect. It is likely to reverse the increase for millions of households on 1 April, under the current cap. The annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity rose to £1,849 per year, an increase of £111, in April. The energy price cap sets the maximum amount customers can be charged for each unit of energy, but actual bills depend on how much gas and electricity you use. The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and isset every three monthsby Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 April and 30 June 2025,gas prices are capped at 6.99p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 27.03p per kWh. This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energy is £1,849 per year. However, analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted that from 1 July this annual bill will fall to £1,720. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay £1,969. The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Between April and June, households on prepayment meters are paying slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,803, a rise of £113 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in January 2025, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap, which changes every three months and can go up or down. They offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price. You may also have to pay a penalty to leave a fixed deal early. Ofgem, the energy regulator, says customers who want the security of knowing what their bill will be should consider moving to a fixed deal. However, it says they should make sure they understand all the costs. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, recommends checking whole-of-market energy price comparison sites to help find the best deal. Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to gas and electricity supplies. Theyvary slightly by region. On 1 April, the average electricity standing charge fell from 60.97p to 53.8p but the average gas standing charge increased from 31.65p to 32.67p Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region saw larger increases. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a bigger proportion of the bill of low energy users. In response, Ofgem has said thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffs from winter 2025. One would have a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another no standing charge but a higher unit rate. However,the proposals have been criticised as being too complicated. TheHousehold Support Fund, which was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customers, has been extended until March 2026. TheWarm Home Discount schemecontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Schemecan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners have not received the money this winter. Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator's price cap. Lenders will have to carry out affordability checks and shoppers will have faster access to refunds under the plans. The UK economy grew by more than expected at the start of 2025.

258882,UK driverless cars coming in 2027 - but Uber says it's ready now,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg80j771zo,"Uber has said it is ""ready to go"" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles. Theprevious administrationsaid fully autonomous cars were ""set to be on roads by 2026"", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027. While limitedself-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used. Withsome companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve. ""We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,"" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride. The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve. It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US. They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore. But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed. ""We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027"", the Department for Transport said in a statement. ""We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,"" it added. In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week. Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel. The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out. That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle. A poll by YouGov in 2024suggested that 37% of Brits would feel ""very unsafe"" travelling in a car without a driver. But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon ""becomes the new normal"". That was certainly my experience during our ride. I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software. It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses. The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes. George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed. If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am – and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty. Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated. But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data. But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in. In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how hisrobotaxi drove round in circlesin an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help. General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns. ""The reality is that one accident is too many,"" said Uber'sMr Macdonald. ""That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers… we operate in the real world and stuff happens."" In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out. Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be ""safety-led"" in the UK. ""Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it – insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur."" The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential ""to build an industry worth £42bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035."" But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving. Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the ""significant social implications"" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered. Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future. ""I've got young kids,"" he said. ""Do I think my daughters will necessarily get their drivers licences when they turn 16?"" [the legal age in his home country, Canada]. ""No – I think the world is changing a lot.""

1026544,Royals and Beckham attend Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q0w2v83wzo,"The Chelsea Flower show opened its gates to royalty and celebrities on Monday, with dogs, unusually, taking the spotlight. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were among the first to tour the gardens on display, being joined by famous figures like football icon David Beckham and actress Cate Blanchett. This year's event favours rewilding and sustainability, with mossy paving, native planting and gravel paths. Designers leaned into natural landscapes shaped by climate change and a growing desire to reconnect with nature. But it was not just the planting that got people talking. The RHS and BBC Radio 2 Dog Garden, created by Monty Don, gave four-legged visitors rare top billing. Created with canine comfort in mind, it features dog-friendly lawns, water for wallowing and shade-providing trees. Names of royal and broadcaster-owned dogs are etched into brick paths – including the late Beth, the Queen's Jack Russell, her new puppy Moley and the King's dog Snuff. Don, not usually a fan of show gardens, said the chance to celebrate the dog-owner bond had won him over. The garden will not be judged and will not stay. After Chelsea, it will find a permanent home at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.

428643,A letter from the M&S hackers landed in my inbox - this is what happened next,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5nen5gxyo,"Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes. The good, the bad, the not-so-sure. I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades. About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore. ""Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?"" the hackers messaged me on Telegram. ""We have some news for you,"" they teased. When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption. Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks. They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information. I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it. They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data. After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack. I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach. Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computersystems were infiltrated.The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began – the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce. Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues. DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion. This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service. The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year. Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings. DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example. The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company. ""DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,"" Ms Baumgaertner said. As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago. ""Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,"" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos. DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks. Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes. Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out. Of course, they are criminals and could be lying. Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money. And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use – who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers? In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police. Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums – hence the description ""scattered"" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike. They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young – in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based. Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too. As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said. Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist. In a message to me, they boasted: ""We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist."" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

629649,Annual energy bills predicted to fall £129 in July,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn5keznpqo,"Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. The bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted. The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more. The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem. The cap changes every three months and the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. This typical household is assumed to use 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. ""The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs,"" said Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight. He added that, while it was ""a step in the right direction"", prices were not falling enough for those households still struggling with cost of living, and bills ""remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade"". ""As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many,"" he said. Abigail Ward, policy manager at the Energy Saving Trust, which promotes energy efficiency, welcomed the forecast of cheaper bills. However she added that ""households will still be paying £100 more a year on their energy bills than last summer, proving that we're still feeling the impacts of fluctuating international wholesale energy markets"". ""This is why we urgently need to see policy action from the UK government to reduce energy bills by upgrading homes at scale."" Andy Manning, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said the drop ""might ease the burden of high bills for some households"", but added that ""it'll be cold comfort for those pushed to the brink by the legacy of the energy crisis"". ""Energy use and bills typically go down during the summer months, but the government can't get complacent,"" he said, calling for more support for those struggling with energy bills. Citizen Advice research from February 2025 shows that 6.7 million people in Great Britain are living in a household in debt to their energy supplier, with over 8.3 million households finding it difficult to afford their energy bills. Last month,Cornwall Insight had predicted a larger fall in the cap- to £1,683 - and it said the new forecast partly reflected higher wholesale energy prices. It predicted the energy price cap would fall again in October, followed by another drop in January 2026. However, it warned these forecasts could be affected by a number of factors, including changing weather patterns, US tariffs, and the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine.

Council leader Bev Craig said the signs ""could be clearer"" and that some other fines issued on the street over the past year would be quashed. After a month-long campaign that included challenging Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham on a BBC Radio Manchester phone-in, she finally won her battle. ""The only part of it that I think is bad is the amount of effort it took to get heard, which is obviously not possible for a proper person to do,"" she told the BBC. She added that ""their system doesn't work, but my system does,"" putting down her success to being ""persistent and annoying"". Zoë Bread said her problems began because the 'Pay At Machine' sign on the street pointed to both a council-run car park and private one. After unsuccessfully arguing her case, she submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the council about how many fines had been issued on the street. But the council knocked it back. She then scoured council documents and found there had been a significant rise in the number of penalties issued in the first year the SIP car park was open. Opposition Liberal Democrat councillor Alan Good applauded Zoë's campaign. But he said it ""shouldn't have taken the social media pressure that was largely due to Zoë's following"". He said the council should cancel fines going back further than the last 12 months, considering the big rise in penalties in 2018, when the privately-run car park was first opened. Council leader Craig - who directly contacted the campaign - said she thanked Zoe for drawing attention to the situation. She said the signs on the street complied with all the rules, but that there would be changes. Craig added: ""We're going to address this as soon as possible with new signs, by relocating the meter and by asking the owners of the nearby private car park to take down their signs which have contributed to confusion. ""As a goodwill gesture, we will also quash any pending or unpaid tickets relating to Collier Street - including Zoe's - and review our records of fines for the last 12 months in that location. ""We will refund anyone who said at the time that they believed they had paid for their parking.""

702304,The inside story of a council held to ransom in cyber-attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw72pxrgdzo,"In the early hours an IT engineer raced into work through the dark, wintery streets of Redcar in north-east England. The dash was prompted by a worrying alert about the council's computer network, and he was soon hurriedly shutting down servers to try to halt the spread of a virus. It was too late. Hackers had scrambled Redcar and Cleveland Council's IT systems andwould soon demand paymentto restore it. The cyber-attack in February 2020 caused chaos, disrupting everything from bin collections to social services and decisions about how to keep vulnerable children safe. ""I got a phone call to say: we've been hit,"" recalls Mary Lanigan, then leader of the council. ""The destruction of our systems was total."" In recent weeks, cyber-criminals have targeted major retailers including M&S and the Co-Op, leading to empty shelves and breaches of customer data. But the former head of the National Cyber Safety Centre (NCSC), Ciaran Martin, said his ""biggest cyber-security worry"" was the threat of simultaneous attacks on public services, like councils and hospitals, which had the potential to ""wreck lives"". The BBC has been investigating how the attack on Redcar and Cleveland unfolded, what it took to get things back to normal and the impact on local people. In the days beforeSaturday 8 February 2020, an email with a seemingly innocuous attachment arrived in a council inbox. Hidden inside was a piece of malicious software that would lie dormant in the council's network until it was activated remotely. Within a few hours of that activation it had spread throughout the computer system, locking staff out and scrambling files. By11:00 GMT on Saturday,local residents began to notice the council website was offline. ""There wasn't a lot we could do,"" Mrs Lanigan said about efforts to stop the virus. ""You had to be practical, so it was actually getting more phones in there so that people could ring us."" News was spreading, but Mrs Lanigan, who lost her position in the 2023 local elections, claims she received pressure from council officials and central government not to speak out. The council declined to be interviewed about the attack but said there had been no pressure or instruction not to speak publicly, either at the time or since. What Mrs Lanigan did not say in 2020, but admits now, was the council was dealing with a crisis. ""It was devastating,"" she said. ""Devastating for us, for the staff, for the public and for everybody else."" They had lost the ability to share information with police and the NHS, while social services and elderly care services were knocked out, she said. ""Even somebody ringing up and saying 'my bin hasn't been emptied' wasn't dealt with.""  Cyber Siege: From Russia to Redcar The inside story of a council in north east England was held to ransom by a dangerous gang of cyber-criminals. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) By the morning ofMonday 10 FebruaryIT staff were desperately going from desk to desk, placing infected computers in a growing pile. ""When we saw how much damage had been caused we realised it would probably take weeks, maybe years to do,"" said IT worker Ben Saunders. At the same time, experts at the NCSC - part of GCHQ - were considering the council's plea for help. Mr Martin, who was the NCSC's chief executive at the time, said it was ""unusually serious"". ""If a council are telling you they are worried about their ability to run services for vulnerable children, you take that very seriously."" It was feared social workers, tasked with keeping young people safe, would struggle to do their jobs without access to the online records they relied on to help inform difficult decisions. In what Mr Martin called an ""unusual"" step, NCSC officers were deployed to Redcar. OnTuesday 11 February– the second working day after the attack - hackers made their ransom demand. The exact figure has never been made public, but Mr Martin said that, based on similar attacks, it was likely to have been in the ""low single figure millions of US dollars"". The current government is considering a ban on the public sector paying ransoms to hackers but, while it is the guidance, there was no formal ban in place in 2020. Regardless, Mrs Lanigan was in no mind to cough up. ""I'm a Yorkshire woman and the thing being about that is there was no way I was paying any ransom to anybody."" The following day,Wednesday 12 February, the government held a Cobra meeting, designed to co-ordinate the response to major emergencies. ""That's when you realised just how serious it was,"" the former council leader said. ""It wasn't just some hacker sat in a bedroom having a play with computers."" While the system was being rebuilt, the council turned the clocks back andreturned to using paper and pen. Many functions ground to a halt or were dramatically slowed down. Redcar husband and wife Paul and Clare were ""very reliant on the council"" at the time. Clare needed support from care workers and specialist equipment to help with a debilitating condition called functional neurological disorder. ""You'd be waiting on the phone for hours,"" Paul said. ""When people were coming it was handwritten notes, so the systems weren't getting updated. It was a real nightmare."" The couple waited many months before they got the support they needed. In the meantime, Paul had quit his job to care for his wife. All the while staff continued to work on getting the council back online and within a few weeks a temporary system for social services had been restored. ByMay 2020the council said it wasstill only back to 90%, with the system taking 10 months to be fully restored. ""Some of it was able to be recovered; a lot of it was needed to be built from scratch,"" said Mr Saunders. ""It was a very meticulous, very long process."" Yet it took several years before evidence emerged suggesting who was behind the cyber-attack. InFebruary 2022, one of the world's most prolific ransomware gangs, the Russia-based Conti Group, fell apart. After Russia invaded its neighbour, pro-Ukrainian hackers leaked the group's private messages and data, revealing details of some of the most dangerous cyber-criminals. A year later, inFebruary 2023, a group ofRussian hackers were sanctionedby UK and US government over a string of attacks on businesses, schools and councils, including Redcar and Cleveland. Earlier that year, Mrs Lanigan gave evidence in Parliament about the attack. She said the response hadcost £11.3m and they had received £3.68m compensationfrom the government. As the authority was not insured for the attack, the difference had to be taken from its limited reserves. A council spokesman said that while it had general insurance cover, it still did not have a specific policy which covered a cyber-attack. They said a recent inspection by external auditors found that at the time the council had had proper arrangements and controls in place to reduce the likelihood of a cyber-security breach. But it is far from the only council to face such an attack. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, there were 202 ransomware attacks on local authorities in 2024. The government said it was ""taking action to protect local councils by providing funding to increase their cyber defences"". But Mr Martin fears the attack on the council, and other public services, could have ""shown hostile nation states how to disrupt our society"". ""Redcar and Cleveland was a crisis,"" he said. ""What about 10 Redcar and Clevelands at the same time? What about a hundred of them? That's not inconceivable."" BBC's Joe Tidy spoke directly to those who claim they are responsible for hacking M&S and Co-op. The retailer has been struggling to get its services back to normal after a cyber-attack in April. The firm says hackers have obtained customer information by paying off employees. Callers ask the Tees Valley Mayor about his involvement in the site in a BBC interview.

257104,"PC Tasered amputee, 92, in wheelchair, court hears",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8dv60dygro,"A 92-year-old care home resident in a wheelchair was sprayed in the face with synthetic pepper spray before being Tasered and hit with a baton by police officers, a jury has been told. PC Stephen Smith emptied almost a full can of pepper spray into Donald Burgess's face when he refused to drop an item of cutlery similar to a butter knife, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mr Burgess, who had one leg, was then Tasered by PC Rachel Comotto, police body-worn camera footage shown to jurors appeared to show. PC Smith, 51, denies two counts of assault by using Pava spray and a baton, and PC Comotto denies one charge of assault by discharging her Taser. Mr Burgess was a resident at a home in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, when staff called police on 21 June 2022 after they failed to persuade him to hand over the knife, which had a specially adapted handle. Paul Jarvis KC, prosecuting, told jurors the officers made no attempt to talk to staff, and instead approached Mr Burgess, trying to interact with him. He said instead of trying to calm the situation down they inflamed it, using force that was unjustified and unlawful. Jurors were told there was nobody within arm's reach of Mr Burgess at the time, and that it should have been clear he was not mobile. ""It ought to have been obvious by the fact he had one leg that this was a man who wasn't going to be mobile,"" Mr Jarvis said. ""This was an elderly, vulnerable man who may not have understood what was going on. ""Rather than being met with understanding and sympathy, he was confronted by irritation and annoyance on the part of the defendants."" The following video contains distressing scenes. Mr Jarvis KC, told the court Mr Burgess was suffering from a urinary tract infection on the day of the incident, a condition that can make a person confused, agitated, or even aggressive. He told the jury Mr Burgess was asked to hand over the knife after he had used it to flick food and poke a member of staff in the stomach. Mr Jarvis said managers had spent 30 minutes trying to get him to put the knife down. Mr Burgess, who suffered from multiple health conditions including diabetes and carotid artery disease, had been a resident at the home since 2018. He had not been diagnosed with dementia, but the care home specialised in support for people with the condition. The court was told that one minute and 23 seconds elapsed between the officers arriving and Mr Burgess being Tasered. In the body-worn camera video PC Smith can be heard repeatedly asking Mr Burgess, who was a right leg amputee, to put down the knife. When he doesn't move, PC Smith sprays him with Pava, before using his baton and 12 seconds later, Mr Burgess can be seen crying out in pain when PC Comotto uses her Taser gun. PC Smith then takes the knife from Mr Burgess. Mr Burgess was taken to hospital after the incident and later contracted Covid. He died 22 days later. Mr Jarvis told the jury: ""I want to make it clear – these defendants are not responsible for his death. ""He was an elderly gentleman who was unwell."" But he added: ""The force used was unnecessary and excessive in the circumstances. ""The defendants assaulted Mr Burgess, causing actual bodily harm."" The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

1094497,I was on a flight - but British Airways told me I wasn't,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3q5kqj80vo,"An extraordinary thing happened to me on a recent flight to Madrid: I unwittingly travelled under the wrong identity, becoming a potential security issue, and no-one realised. I was packing for a short business trip to make a film for the BBC when I attempted to check-in online. It didn't work, so I headed to London Heathrow Airport to do it in person. Upon arrival there, I tried once again to check myself in, this time at a self-service booth. Again I was denied, the machine flashing up an error code: ""Assistance required."" I ended up at a check-in desk and after checking in my bag, a British Airways staff member handed me a boarding pass. Admittedly I didn't read the pass in any detail, but headed off to get processed in the security area as normal. At the gate, I was among the first passengers to board flight BA7055 departing at 10:50 on 23 April, operated by BA's Spanish partner carrier Iberia, as I was in row six. Dutifully, I handed my passport and boarding pass to a member of BA ground crew, who glanced at them both and waved me through. Once on board I realised my seat was in business class. I assumed this must have been a free upgrade, because I would of course usually have been in economy; we had chosen this flight because it was the most cost-effective option with all our filming equipment. No sooner were we off the tarmac and at cruising altitude than the delicious baked cod and chickpea stew lunch was served. Tiramisu for dessert, too. No complimentary alcohol for me though; it was a work trip. It was on arrival in the Spanish capital when things started to go wrong. As soon as I gained mobile signal on the ground, an email popped up: my return flight had been cancelled. I asked the BBC's travel provider what had happened and what the plan was for getting me home? In response, the travel company said it had been cancelled because I was a no-show on the outbound flight. I explained that I was in fact very much in Madrid and waiting - endlessly, it seemed - to collect my checked luggage from the baggage belt. After some no doubt confusing conversations between our travel team and BA, I received a further message to say the airline was adamant I had not travelled and that the boarding pass in my possession did not display the correct details. This was when I realised that the name on my boarding pass was not mine, it was a man called Huw H. The BBC is not using Huw H's full name, which was printed on the pass. His name was also printed on my luggage tags. BA claimed there was no way I could have travelled using that document as security checks wouldn't allow it - but I did. My colleague, who was seated a few rows behind me, can vouch for me being on that plane. The airline was so sure that I was not in Madrid that the BBC had to book me another seat on the flight home I was originally booked onto, at great expense. BA has since offered a £500 goodwill voucher as well as refunding the cost of the extra ticket. The security protocol for passengers boarding flights is relatively simple: ground crew must check the name on the boarding pass matches that on the passport presented. This process appears to have broken down in my case - with no-one at check-in or the boarding gate identifying the discrepancy between the name on the boarding pass and my passport. So what went wrong, and who is Huw H? I tried to find out. Some internet sleuthing brought limited proof of Huw H's existence. I made a few attempts to contact accounts using his full name via various social media channels, to no avail. It's made me fear that he might not even exist. I did manage to get in touch with someone with a similar name - Jonathan Huw H - who, it turns out, flew on a BA flight on 24 April, a day after mine, landing at Heathrow, so is it possible his name was somehow floating around in the BA system? ""It's really worrying,"" Jonathan told me. My married name, which was on my booking confirmation and passport, begins with the letter H - though is very different to Huw H's surname. Could this have factored in? It's impossible to know, and BA cannot confirm anything for privacy reasons. Simon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, said it was to be expected that mistakes will sometimes happen ""in the high-pressure, deadline-strewn world of aviation"". But he added: ""This case is unusual in that the error wasn't picked up at the departure gate, where it could have been easily rectified. ""The airline needs urgently to investigate and make amends."" Aviation security and operations expert Julian Bray added: ""There is a security issue here, in that the plane took off with an incorrect passenger manifest. ""It is wrong and shouldn't have happened. The passenger manifest should be correct as it is an important document that shows who is travelling and where. That said, as the name on the baggage tag matched the one on the boarding pass and the correct number of people were on board when the plane took off, I can see how it happened."" Others would argue that it was not a security risk, though, because both myself and my luggage went through all the usual security checks. A spokesperson for BA, which managed my ticket as well as the Heathrow ground crew in my case, said: ""We've contacted our customer to apologise for this genuine human error. While incidents like this are extremely rare, we've taken proactive steps to ensure it doesn't happen again."" Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority has told me it has launched an investigation into what happened. Heathrow Airport said in response to a request for comment that it was not responsible for the ground crew or anything else in my case, and security screening went ahead as normal. Iberia, whose only involvement in my journey was operating the outbound plane and cabin crew, has not responded to a request for comment. As is nothing out of the ordinary, my passport and boarding pass were not manually checked on the plane. Apologies and investigations aside, the question remains how this was ever possible in this day and age of high security. On social media there are threads about this type of thing happening around the world in the past, but the mistake was rectified before take-off as there were two people trying to sit in the same seat. What happened to me appears to be different as my name was seemingly replaced with someone who seemingly wasn't travelling to Spain that day. I'm not sure I'll ever really know what happened, but one thing is for sure - I won't ever walk away from a check-in desk without reading every detail printed on my boarding pass in future.

406349,Domestic abuse victim data stolen in Legal Aid hack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5g4pv2l0o,"A ""significant amount"" of private data including details of domestic abuse victims has been hacked from Legal Aid's online system. The Ministry of Justice said the agency's services were hacked in April and data dating back to 2010 was downloaded. The BBC understands that more than two million pieces of information were taken. The breach covers all areas of the aid system - including domestic abuse victims, those in family cases and others facing criminal prosecution. ""This data may have included... addresses of applicants, dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment and financial data such as... debts and payments,"" the MoJ said. The agency's chief executive Jane Harbottle apologised, saying she understood the news ""will be shocking and upsetting for people"". Justice minister Sarah Sackman told the House of Commons that there was no indication as yet that any other government systems had been affected by the breach. The MoJ said that while the initial cyber-attack was detected in April, it has since become apparent that the incident was ""more extensive than originally understood"". It also warned the public to be alert for any suspicious activity, including unknown messages or phone calls, and to update any potentially exposed passwords. ""If you are in doubt about anyone you are communicating with online or over the phone you should verify their identity independently before providing any information to them,"" it said. The ministry said it was working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre, and has informed the Information Commissioner. Legal aid is offered to cover the costs of legal advice, family mediation and representation in a court or tribunal for those who qualify. This includes those who are at risk of abuse or serious harm, discrimination, forced marriage, as well as those defending themselves in criminal cases. The Legal Aid Agency'sonline digital services, which are used by legal aid providers to log their work and get paid by the government, have been taken offline. The Law Society, which represents the legal profession, said the MoJ needed to ""get a grip of the situation immediately"" and notify all those affected individually. ""It is extremely concerning that members of the public have had their personal data compromised,"" it added. The agency is the latest victim in a series of recent cyber-attacks that have caused mass disruption. Earlier this month, luxury department store Harrods said it had ""restricted internet access at our sites"" following an attempt to gain access to its systems. An attack on Marks & Spencer in April caused it to lose out on millions of pounds of sales and left it struggling to get services back to normal. A similar incident at the Co-op forced it to shut down parts of its IT systems and disrupted deliveries of fresh stock. Copyright 2025 BBC.

896776,UK-EU deal on Irish Sea border could 'lower food prices',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce81m8zgzrlo,"Most food and plant products will be allowed ""to flow freely again"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said. The agri-food deal will remove ""routine checks"" on animal and plant products moving between GB and NI and will reduce, but not remove, the trade border in the Irish Sea which was introduced as a result of Brexit. When the deal is eventually implemented it should mean no physical checks on GB food products at NI ports but customs declarations will still be needed. The government said the broader UK-EU deal ""could lower food prices and increase choice on supermarket shelves"". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the wide-ranging agreement affecting food, fishing and security after hosting EU leaders at a summit in London. It includes a new SPS agreement - which stands for sanitary and phytosanitary and refers to rules about animals and food. The government said this would reduce red tape for businesses, simplify food exports and imports, and help cut lorry queues at borders. The deal also includes a new security and defence partnership between the UK and EU, and new arrangements for passport checks. British holidaymakers will soon be able to use more eGates in Europe, which the government said would ""end the dreaded queues"" at border control. Sir Keir said the deal would be ""good for jobs, good for bills and good for our borders"". However, critics accused the Labour government of betraying Brexit voters as the UK will have to follow EU agri-food rules without having a say in how those rules are made. There are also concerns about a 12-year fishing deal granting the EU access to UK waters, which is included as part of the overall agreement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK was ""becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again"". But the Labour government said it was time to ""reset"" relations with the EU which is the UK's biggest market. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK's agricultural food exports were down by a fifth, and the new deal would reduce trade friction and costs. By John Campbell, NI economics and business editor  The agri-food deal between the EU and UK should substantially ease trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The UK has agreed that it will align with EU rules on agri-food which will mean Northern Ireland and Great Britain return to following the same set of rules. That will mean food being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will no longer need the paperwork and checks which have been in place since 2021. The deal needs to be finalised as a legal text, which could take several months, with any implementation likely be to next year at the earliest. The deal will also cover the trade in horticultural products like seeds and garden plants. Northern Ireland's current trading arrangement came about as the result of a Brexit deal between the EU and UK in 2019, which was revised in 2023, and is now known as theWindsor Framework. They agreed that the most practical way to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was for Northern Ireland to follow many EU laws on the regulation of goods. However this means that goods coming from the rest of the UK into Northern Ireland face checks and controls to ensure they meet EU rules. This arrangement has become known as the Irish Sea border. It has had a particular impact on the food industry as Northern Ireland supermarkets are still largely supplied from distribution centres in England and Scotland. The new deal should substantially reduce the impact of the sea border for food and plants as there will be no regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However the deal does not cover thetrade in animal medicineswhich is currently covered by a ""grace period"". When that grace period ends in December it means Northern Ireland will have to follow EU rules which could lead to disruption of supplies from Great Britain.  Business organisations have been digesting the details of what the agreement means for Northern Ireland. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry, said the SPS agreement was ""a significant win which should facilitate smoother trade"". The Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry also welcomed the agreement but said it ""would not solve all the challenges our members face"". ""We would like to see greater aspiration to tackle regulatory divergence more broadly, and to reduce the customs burden under the Windsor Framework,"" said its chief executive Suzanne Wylie. Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the deal marked ""genuine progress by untangling the rules for small exporters of plant and animal products"". ""Of course, this deal does not solve every challenge overnight, but it sets a very welcome new tone,"" she added. Ulster Farmers' Union President William Irvine described the agreement as ""a significant breakthrough"" that brings ""real, long-term certainty"" for their members and the wider agri-food industry. ""Fear managed to defeat fury"" is how one analyst interpreted liberal Nicusor Dan beating hard-right George Simion to the presidency.

601596,Kenya signs Crown dependencies recruitment deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e0g2rd0no,"A Channel Islands business has signed a deal with the Kenyan government to enable staff to be recruited to work in the three UK Crown dependencies. The agreement between recruitment firm GR8 and the Kenyan government would pave the way for staff to be recruited to work in Jersey and Guernsey and on the Isle of Man, organisers said. Leaders said the agreement would make it easier for east African hospitality, construction, childcare and health workers to fill vacancies in the Crown dependencies. GR8 CEO Lee Madden signed a memorandum of understanding with Roseline Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, in a ceremony in Jersey. A GR8 spokesperson said the company was now a strategic partner for recruiting Kenyans into the Crown dependencies, strengthening business links with the east African country. Njogu said: ""We are inviting good employers to come and recruit from Kenya from the talent that we have that is abundant in IT, healthcare, education, engineering and so on."" Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, is on an official visit to Jersey, alongside Kenyan politicians and senior government officials. During their visit, they will also meet the Minister for External Relations Ian Gorst and representatives from organisations including Highlands College, Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the Jersey Construction Council. Minister for Sustainable Economic Development Kirsten Morel, said: ""I hope this partnership flourishes, ensuring that Jersey remains an attractive and welcoming place for overseas skilled workers from multiple industries to live and work."" Lee Madden, the chief executive of GR8, said the agreement enabled them to speak on behalf of the Kenyan government in terms of recruitment. He said the recruitment of hospitality staff from Kenya had been ""instrumental in solving the recruitment crisis that was three to four years ago"". GR8 began working with partners in Kenya five years ago, starting a close business relationship with a college that saw trained hospitality workers brought over to help support businesses struggling to recruit staff following Brexit. Since then, it has recruited hundreds of skilled workers from sectors including hospitality, construction and health care sectors into roles in Jersey and Guernsey, with the majority coming from Kenya.

839044,Boy died after pier jump to celebrate end of exams,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04e53eqv3eo,"A teenager who died after jumping into the sea from a pier had told friends he ""couldn't swim"", an inquest has heard. David Ejimofor, 15,died at Aberavon beach, Neath Port Talbot, on 19 June 2023after joining friends at the beach to celebrate the end of their GCSE exams. The hearing, at Swansea's Guildhall, heard from a fisherman who said he heard the boy telling other teenagers he ""couldn't swim"". His mother, Maria Ejimofor, described her son as ""beautiful young boy,"" who was ""bright and sporty"". The fisherman, Ethan Clarke, said he heard the teenagers telling the boy ""it would be fine"" despite telling them he could not swim. Mr Clarke said the teenager jumped in and he began to panic as soon as he entered the water. He then disappeared under the water at which point the teenagers called for help. Tyler Rowland, an off-duty police officer, was paddleboarding with his partner at the beach. He noticed a group of seven teenagers at the pier about 19:00 BST, with some in the sea. He saw three head back to shore and told the inquest he heard them saying ""he's gone"". Mr Rowland said one teenager told him his friend had ""gone under the water and not come back up"". Mr Rowland jumped off his paddleboard and swam over to the group as they frantically looked for David. The inquest heard he dived down several times before finding David's body. He was helped to carry the body to shore by a nurse called Amy Saunders who was at the beach. In a statement read out in court, she described the efforts to rescue David at the beach as ""never experiencing trauma like it"". Simon Davies, Det Sgt of South Wales Police, who led the investigation, told the court it was ""chaotic scenes"" when he arrived at the beach with emergency services trying to revive David. The coroner asked Mr Davies if there was any evidence that David ""entered the water not of his own free will"". He said ""no, none whatsoever"". He told the inquest David's mobile phone was taken away as evidence and that revealed the phone had been used to search for two things before David's death. They were ""how long should I wait after eating before swimming"" and ""what shorts to wear for swimming"". Previous searches were about sport training and nutrition. The coroner also read a statement from David's mother, Maria Ejimofor, who said he had won athletics competitions, was a keen weightlifter and made TikTok tutorials on social media. His mother's statement said he ""achieved so much in his 15 years"" and had aspirations to become a doctor. She said he could swim after having lessons as a child but he was not confident in the water. The statement added ""he would not have put himself in a dangerous situation"" because he was not a risk taker. He often went to the beach because his family lived close by but was always cautious of the sea. A statement was also read from Associated British Ports (ABP) who own the structure where David and his friends were. It said the structure was not designed for recreational use, as it was ""built as a break water and is not a pier"". ""The purpose of it is to protect the entrance of Port Talbot docks from wind and waves,"" the statement added. It also said there are signs warning of the dangers and it is checked monthly. The inquest continues. Former staff and guests have come forward with their memories after an appeal to track down the faces featured in an exhibition. Ann and Bernard McDonagh had a carefully practised plan which they would act out each time. Ministers should have been better at planning and making sure green jobs were available, report says. The chair and crown for Eisteddfod yr Urdd paid tribute to the local industrial heritage. McFly star Harry Judd says seeing the crowd chanting Joel's name was ""so cool"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

469250,Criminals could fill potholes and clean bins under government plans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj7d1dwz1vo,"Convicted criminals could be told to fill potholes and clean bins under plans the government is understood to be developing. As firstreported by the Sun on Sunday,the Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is said to want to expand unpaid work, which she believes to be too lenient. She is understood to want probation teams to work with councils, so that local authorities are able to assign jobs to offenders. Private companies would also be able to employ those who are on community sentences. Offenders would not be paid wages, but the money earned would be paid into a fund for victim's groups. It comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a new high. A government source said: ""With prisons so close to collapse, we are going to have to punish more offenders outside of prison. ""We need punishment to be more than just a soft option or a slap on the wrist. If we want to prove that crime doesn't pay, we need to get offenders working for free - with the salary they would have been paid going back to their victims."" They added this meant doing the jobs the public ""really want them to do - not just scrubbing graffiti, butfilling up potholesand cleaning the bins"". Writing forthe Telegraph, Ms Mahmood, who describes herself as a ""card-carrying member"" of her party's ""law and order wing"", said that ""tough community orders work."" An independent review of sentencing carried out by the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke is expected to be published this week. It was commissioned last year after overcrowding led to the early release of thousands of prisoners. Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review, andis likely to recommend more community-based sentencingto reduce the reliance on imprisonment. In an interim report,Gauke warnedthat unless radical changes were made, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells by early next year. Ms Mahmood warned that he would ""have to recommend bold, and sometimes difficult, measures"". In her article, she pointed to examples such as the system in Texas, where she said ""offenders who comply with prison rules earn an earlier release, while those who don't are locked up for longer"". On Wednesday, she announced more than a thousand inmates will be released early to free up spaces in prisons in England and Wales, and that a £4.7bn investment will be used to fund more prisons. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the announcement was ""failing to protect the public"" - adding ""to govern is to choose, and today she's chosen to release early criminals who've reoffended or breached their licences"". Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood says the review is to ""leave no stone unturned"". Shabana Mahmood said judges at the UK's highest court had provided ""legal clarity"". The Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research found 64 people died in jail in 2024 - up from 40 in 2023. The Ministry of Justice confirms the officer was injured just days after another disturbance. The new category C Millsike jail near Stamford Bridge will eventually house up to 1,500 prisoners.

745630,Fire chief took own life after harassment - inquest,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg784lxgq7o,"A fire chief took his own life because he ""couldn't take it any more"" after months of alleged harassment and questions over his qualifications, an inquest has heard. Wayne Brown, chief fire officer at West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS), wasfound dead at his flatin Birmingham by police on the morning of 24 January last year. Mr Brown had been under scrutiny from colleagues over claims he had lied on his CV. His partner, Nicola White, told the first day of the inquest on Monday that attention from the national press was the ""final straw"". Birmingham Coroners' Court heard that in the days before his death, aninternal investigationhad been launched at WMFS into a claim Mr Brown had lied about having an MBA (Master of Business Administration), a requirement for chief fire officers. Satinder Sahota, monitoring officer for WMFS, said Mr Brown, who had been in the role permanently since April 2023, admitted he had started an MBA but had not finished it and apologised for putting it on his CV. Ms White said her partner was clearly ""low"" about the ongoing investigation, but when a national news outlet ran a story about him, ""He just couldn't take it anymore. I said, 'Wayne, you need to speak to someone,' but he didn't like to show his weaknesses."" She added: ""On the Tuesday... I did think to ask him, 'You're not going to do anything silly, are you?' But I put that thought immediately out of my head because I thought he would never do that."" Ms White said her partner did say that he felt supported by the fire service. However, Mr Sahota said Mr Brown was a ""private and stoic"" man who did not seek the support from occupational health colleagues that he was urged to take during their meetings. On one occasion, days before he died, Mr Brown told Mr Sahota that he was feeling under pressure, was exhausted, was struggling to sleep and had ""racing thoughts"". Mr Sahota told the inquest: ""My view at the time was that he was saying he was okay. I urged him to reach out to occupational health. ""I had to be careful with Wayne... I didn't want to annoy him; it was quite clear he was private, and he was the most senior person in the organisation, and I didn't want to be disrespectful of that because it would affect my relationship with him going forward."" Deputy fire chief Joanne Bowcock said in a statement that she recognised Mr Brown was under pressure but that she never considered he would take his own life. And added he appeared to be coping well, but when speaking to him on 18 January, he told her he had had ""the worst two weeks of his life"" and feared he would be suspended. Det Ch Insp Jonathan Kiteley of West Midlands Police told the court Mr Brown was also ""frustrated"" that a court date for a man charged with harassing him had been pushed back. ""I had no idea he would go on to take his own life, but I could tell the constant barrage of contact was getting to him,"" said Mr Kiteley. The charges against the manwere droppedfollowing Mr Brown's death. Senior coroner Louise Hunt, who presided over the inquest, said Mr Brown had died as a result of suicide and indicated she would be writing a Prevention of Future Deaths report to WMFS to raise concerns. She said the fire service did not undertake any investigation following Mr Brown's death so lessons could be learnt and was concerned that there was no policy requiring them to do so. Mrs Hunt was also concerned that there appeared to be no mechanism for recording concerns raised about the welfare of staff during a fact-finding or formal investigation and that there was no provision in the service's health and wellbeing or mental health policy for employees as senior as Mr Brown was. In a tribute, Mr Brown's son Kai said he was ""loved and respected"", had many friends and was their ""shining star"". He said: ""We will be forever proud of him, and he leaves a void in our lives which will never be filled."" The inquest continues. Follow BBC Birmingham onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

105408,Festival aims to bring 'Edinburgh magic' to city,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y52yy29gzo,"A festival held in Wolverhampton this summer hopes to bring ""a bit of Edinburgh magic"" to the Midlands. The Midlands Fringe festival is set to be held at three venues in the city centre, with 15 shows, from 25 to 27 July. It is organised by Poets, Prattlers, and Pandemonialists, a collective of Black Country poets, writers and performers including Dave Pitt, Steve Pottinger and Emma Purshouse. ""We've been talking about doing it for a few years, we felt like it would be great to have something and use the small venues that are available,"" said Mr Pottinger. The festival is funded by just under £9,000 from Arts Council England. The venues are K Teas Cakes, on St George's Parade, Cafe Royale, on Victoria Street, and The Lych Gate Tavern, Queen Square. There will also be two headline comedy shows consisting of two ""top comedians"" who will perform their Edinburgh Fringe Festival shows at the Arena Theatre. These performances are not funded by the Arts Council money. Poets, Prattlers, and Pandemonialists said it had begun taking submissions for performers, adding that due to the size of the venues, shows would need to be one or two performers. Submissions must be entered by 7 June. ""Wolverhampton is blessed with great transport links and vibrant independent venues,"" said Ms Purshouse. ""We hope to make Midlands Fringe an annual event, building it year on year, bringing the best in fringe and comedy here to celebrate our city.""

745,"EU deal disastrous for Scotland, says fishing body",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c057n0745qjo,"Some sections of Scotland's fishing industry have accused Sir Keir Starmer's government of ""capitulating"" to the EU over a deal on access to UK waters. Labour ministers have agreed a 12-year deal which extends existing access for EU boats in exchange for reduced checks and restrictions on food exports. The agreement was described as ""disastrous"" by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) while Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said it was a ""great betrayal of our fishing fleet"". But fish farming body Salmon Scotland welcomed the deal as a ""slashing of red tape"" which will allow Scottish products and people easier access to the EU. The prime minister officially announced the deal as part of the first UK-EU summit, describing it as a ""win-win"". He said it would ""tear down"" barriers to trade and end the ""needlessly difficult"" process of selling Scottish products in Europe. Starmer added the fishing agreement would protect UK access with no increase in EU vessels, while other measures meant shellfish could now be sold again in Europe. ""This agreement isn't about revisiting the stale old debates of the past,"" he said. ""It's time now for Britain to look forwards and outwards as a proud, sovereign nation on the world stage - to get the best deal for the people of Scotland and Britain. "" The new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement (SPS) would also benefit other agricultural exporters while holidaymakers will be able to use eGates at some airports to cut down on passport queue wait times, Starmer added. Forbes welcomed closer co-operation which ""unpicks a small part of the damage that  Brexit continues to inflict"". But she criticised the lack of consultation with the Scottish government over the fishing deal. ""Given the importance of fishing to Scotland it is also astonishing that the Scottish government was giving no warning of this great betrayal of our fishing fleet,"" she said. The previous post-Brexit deal saw the UK regain 25% of fishing rights from the EU, but it also gave European boats continuous access to UK waters. Itwas due to expire at the end of June 2026but the new agreement will see that extended until the summer of 2038. Thedeal does not include any change to current access to fish for coastal communities. There is no reduction in the British quota or increase in the quota the EU is allowed to catch. But SFF chief executive Elspeth Macdonald said she was worried the agreement would end any ""leverage"" the UK has in future negotiations. She toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""This is not a roll over, it's a total capitulation to the EU and a disastrous outcome for the Scottish fishing fleet. ""The EU have clearly reneged on a deal that they signed up to in 2020 and have said that they require to have another multi-year deal. ""But in doing so the UK loses all its negotiating capital and all its leverage, so the EU continues to take a far bigger share of the resources in our waters than they are entitled to. ""We've always been in this position where fishing seems to be the expendable price for something else that the UK wants."" While the deal has been criticised, it has also been welcomed in other parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries. Tavish Scott, chief executive of Salmon Scotland, said the new agreement would help cut the time taken to get products into the EU market. The body said international sales of salmon from Scotland hit a record £844m in 2024, with France, where Scottish salmon is given the ""Label Rouge"" quality mark, the largest market at £462m. Mr Scott said the deal could open up new opportunities for Scottish producers in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where demand is rising despite tough competition from Norway and Chile. ""This breakthrough will ease the burden on our farmers, processors and the communities they support,"" he said. ""Scottish salmon is the UK's largest food export, with strong demand in the EU, the US and beyond."" The deal also benefits shellfish producers after the EUbanned British fishermen from selling live mussels, oysters, clams, cockles and scallopsto its member states in 2021. Under those rules, fishermen were previously not allowed to transport the animals to the EU unless they had already been treated in purification plants. Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Association, described the deal as an ""utter betrayal"". He said it was the ""third time"" the fishing industry had been ""sold down the river,"" citing decisions by former prime minister Ted Heath, who took the UK into the EU in 1973, and Boris Johnson, who negotiated its exit in the aftermath of Brexit in 2020. Mr Park said: ""We understand the free flow of food products, the EU benefit from that and the UK benefit from it. ""But here we have a massive fleet coming into UK waters and the UK fishing industry gets nothing out of it."" Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon and Buchan, Harriet Cross, described the deal as a ""surrender"" and ""one of the biggest acts of betrayal that our fishing industry has seen in Scotland."" She said: ""Our fishermen have been used as a pawn by Keir Starmer, which will result in catastrophic consequences for our coastal communities."" The UK government also announced a £360m fund to invest in coastal communities as part of the agreement. It said that would go towards new technology and equipment to modernise the fleet, training to upskill workforces and help to ""revitalise"" coastal communities. About 4,000 people are employed in Scotland's commercial sea fishing industry,according to a Scottish government report published in 2023. In 2022, it brought £335m into the Scottish economy, more than half of which came from Aberdeenshire, including the UK's largest fishing port at Peterhead. The fish farming and aquaculture industries account for about 2,200 jobs andbrought in £337m to the Scottish economy in 2022. Keir Starmer has described this UK-EU deal as a ""win-win"" but that is not necessarily how it is viewed by every part of the Scottish fishing industry. The sharply contrasting reactions of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation - which has accused the UK government of ""capitulation"" - and Salmon Scotland, which has welcomed an agreement it believes will ""slash red tape"", underlines the fact that any deal involves trade-offs. The UK government is trying to offset the disappointment of some in the fishing industry with a £360m fund for coastal communities. There are aspects of closer cooperation between the UK and EU that the Scottish government is happy to welcome. However, there was never going to be a package that would satisfy SNP ministers, as they favour a return to the EU. They argue the best way for that to be achieved is through Scottish independence. But that debate has lost much of its previous energy. An earlier ""reset"" in relations between the UK and devolved governments has improved how they work together. But Scottish ministers argue that they should have been consulted on today's deal, despite foreign affairs being a matter reserved to Westminster. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning. Copyright 2025 BBC.

639055,Eurovision: 'What the Hell Just Happened' to the UK entry?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk2nrkv830o,"Oh no, not again. For the third year in a row, the UK has crashed out at Eurovision, taking 19th place out of a possible 26. It feels particularly cruel this time because our contestants, Remember Monday, got a lot of things right with their song, What the Hell Just Happened. Most notably, they could sing – and I mean, really, really sing. Lauren, Holly and Charlotte hit every harmony in their song, What The Hell Just Happened, with pinpoint precision, drawing on a decade of West End experience that's seen them star in everything from Matilda to Phantom Of The Opera. After toe-curling performances from Olly Alexander in 2024 and Mae Muller in 2023, their vocals were as strong as a lion's roar. So strong, in fact, that they caught the attention of former Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst. ""Harmonising on the Eurovision stage has hardly worked out in the past, but they're spot on,"" Conchita enthused before the final. ""Their confidence is incredible. You immediately trust them, because when you feel the artist is nervous, you get nervous as a viewer. But they are just so light and so sharp."" So what went wrong? The chief culprit, if I'm honest, was the song. A manic mish-mash of musical styles, it sped up in the verses, and slowed down for the choruses, with all the consistency of a jelly in a heatwave. That's not to say it's a bad piece of writing. Indeed, all of the UK's 88 points came from professional juries of songwriters, whose job it is to recognise compositional craft. Italy even gave us the top score of 12. Grazie mille! They'll have recognised all the clever British touches the band crammed in – Elton John-style piano crescendos, a Beatles-esque mellotron riff, and a vocal callback to George Michael's Freedom '90. The lyrics were witty, too. Reminiscent of Katy Perry's Last Friday Night (TGIF), or If I Were a Bell from Guys and Dolls, it was all about the drunken mistakes you make while trying to get over an ex. ""Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee / When I fell from the chandelier."" In three short minutes, the trio rattled off half a dozen memorable hooks, all imbued with the unbreakable bond of their friendship. But as seasoned Eurovision watcher Jonathan Vautrey noted, the song was simply too busy. ""It's hard to latch on to exactly what they're selling when you're too busy reeling from the constant whiplash of hearing an almost brand new song every 30 seconds,""he wrote on the Wiwibloggs fansite last month.. ""Although I've been able to settle into the entry overtime, and now appreciate the theatricality of it all, first impressions matter at Eurovision."" That's an opinion I heard more than once. But still, I had hope. Catching a tram to Basel's St Jackobshalle arena on Saturday, I was stopped by a Swedish woman who'd spotted my UK media pass. She wanted to tell me how she'd dismissed Remember Monday's song when auditioning this year's Eurovision songs on Spotify. Then she saw their spirited performance in the semi-final ""and I understood"". Good enough for one vote, then. So why didn't more people connect with it? The staging was put together by Ace Bowerman, who is one of the UK's most respected creative directors – responsible for Blackpink's Born Pink world tour and Dua Lipa's lockdown spectacular, Studio 2054. Speaking before the final, she told me the performance deliberately made a virtue of the girls' friendship. ""As soon as I met them, I was like, 'Please be my friend!'"" she told me, ""They are electric people, they have such a special bond. So the one thing I want everybody to take away from the performance is how much fun they are – because the audience will want to be their friends as well."" It was camp and fun, but lacked the scale of Finland's Erika Vikman, who soared above the audience on a giant phallic microphone, or the drama of Austrian winner JJ, who was tossed around the stage in the stormy sea of his own emotions. ""The UK's staging wasn't flat at all but, as with the song, it was maybe a bit too much,"" says Alexander Beijar, Eurovision reporter at Finnish broadcaster Yle. ""It was like, we have three minutes, and we'll show you everything we can do on this stage: We'll start in bed, we'll dance on a chandelier, we'll strut down the catwalk, and we'll end up in the bed again in the end. ""I think maybe tone it down just a nod for next year. ""Then again, as a Finn, with the biggest microphone you can find in the whole of Switzerland, maybe I shouldn't give advice!"" And what about that wrinkly old Eurovision chestnut: Politics? Vote trading is an age-old tradition at the contest. Since Sweden first took part in 1958, for example, more than one-fifth of its votes have come from Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. But the situation is complicated. Political tensions persist in the Balkans, ""but the cultural connections seem to have trumped the political divisions"", Dean Vuletic, author of Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, recently told the AFP news agency. ""I would say that this is because these countries do share a music industry."" The UK's music industry isn't particularly well integrated with Europe, tending to ride roughshod over its less influential neighbours. When it comes to friendly neighbours, our reputation took a hit after Brexit - although Luxembourg has always been a reliable source of votes, for reasons that aren't 100% clear. But here's the thing: You can only vote for a country in Eurovision, not against it. Remember Monday were good, but were they good enough to make your personal Top 10? If so, then great – you'd have given them some points. Otherwise, it's a struggle to accrue any momentum. In the end, that was Remember Monday's fate: Another zero-point disappointment. So where does that leave the UK going into next year? Well, we laid good foundations. Remember Monday didn't come with a copycat Eurodance hit, or an insipid ballad. The vocals were strong. The staging conveyed personality. Their energy was infectious and they made friends across Europe, becoming great ambassadors for the UK in the contest. Their 88 jury points almost doubled last year's score. We just have to find a way to get the public vote back on side. In other words, we shouldn't be too down on the band themselves, as Scott Mills and Graham Norton discussed on Radio 2 this weekend. ""I thought they were spectacular, so I don't really mind where they place, because it's not embarrassing,"" said Mills. ""I'm with you,"" Norton agreed. ""They're so likeable. Whatever happens, they walk away heads held high."" Mills cautioned against the creeping allure of cynicism. ""There's a section of fans [who] will complain every year, whatever the UK does: 'Oh, the song's too generic, the vocals aren't great.' ""We could send Adele and they'd have something horrible to say. ""But the whole thing about Eurovision is that it's fun and it's joy through music… so please don't spoil it. Go and be miserable somewhere else."" And that's exactly the attitude we need. The UK's never going to attract world-class talent if all we do is look down on the contest and approach it with a defeatist attitude. Luckily, three people have already put their names in the ring for next year. ""Listen,"" said Remember Monday's Lauren Byrne when I bumped into her backstage on Thursday. ""If we do really badly, we're just gonna keep coming back until we win."" We'll remember, Remember Monday. See you in Vienna next year. Pedro Sánchez warns against ""double standards"" after Russia was banned from the song contest in 2022. The pop star performed in front of hundreds outside Sheffield Town Hall on Sunday.

But that's not all the week has in store. Sex Education's Connor Swindells stars in new BBC drama seriesThe Bombing of Pan Am 103, Nicole Kidman returns for season 2 ofNine Perfect Strangers, and Peter Andre's controversial filmJafaicanis coming out. Read on for what's coming up this week... The highly anticipated eighth film in the long-running Tom Cruise-led spy action series is almost here. Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoninghits cinemas on Wednesday, and sees Ethan Hunt - played by Cruise - racing against time to find a rogue artificial intelligence, known as the Entity, that can destroy mankind. Many reviews have been positive. Writing in the Independent, Clarisse Loughreyawarded it four stars, saying she ""adored it"". Peter Bradshawawarded it five starsin the Guardian, labelling it ""wildly entertaining"". ButHollywood Reporter's chief film criticDavid Rooney was more critical, calling it ""a disappointing farewell with a handful of high points courtesy of the indefatigable lead actor"". As ever, there's loads of focus on the stunts, with the film's social media account and trailer promoting plenty of impressive sequences, including 62-year-old Cruise hanging precariously off a helicopter. ""Your jaw will detach and your palms will leak sweat,""writes John Nugent in Empire. By Helen Bushby, entertainment reporter The BBC's new six-part drama,The Bombing of Pan Am 103, is aboutthe UK's most deadly terror atrocity, when a bomb in the hold of a flight from London to New York exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people in 1988. A drama exploring what happened in the aftermath, a co-production with Netflix, reveals the painstaking police operation to find out who was behind the bombing. But it also explores the impact on victims' families, and the huge kindness they were shown by the town's volunteers. Its cast includes Sex Education star Connor Swindells, Peter Mullan, Phyllis Logan, Patrick J Adams, Merrit Wever and Lauren Lyle. Kara Weipz, whose brother Richard died in the crash, told me that ""lessons were learned"" in how victims' families were treated, after she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead via a news report. They should, of course, have been told in person. She hopes the drama will generate some positivity after so much pain and anguish. It's on BBC iPlayer and BBC One from 9pm this Sunday, and will be on Netflix globally at a later date. There has been a fair bit of controversy over Peter Andre's new film,Jafaican, which hits cinemas on Tuesday. The trailer saw the Mysterious Girl singer donning long dreadlocks and speaking in a Jamaican accent, which led to criticism from some viewers. Andre did not respond to a request for comment from BBC News. But speakingto Australia's Channel 7, he addressed the backlash, saying: ""I think it's good to get all sorts of feedback."" ""For me, it's acting - I get to do something light-hearted, something funny. Something that is the kind of film I'd want to watch."" The film tells the tale of a small-time crook, Gazza, who hatches a scam in a bid to secure £35,000 for his grandmother's care. With just 21 days to pull it off, he must immerse himself in Jamaican culture to con his way between London and Jamaica. Nicole Kidman is having quite the year. She's already been in Babygirl, a film that sparked hundreds of memes, and starred alongside Succession's Matthew Macfadyen in Holland. Now, she's back for season 2 ofNine Perfect Strangers, which drops on Prime Video on Thursday. The show sees nine new strangers, connected in ways they could never imagine, invited by celebrity wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko (played by Kidman) to join a wellness retreat in the Austrian Alps. Over the course of a week, she takes them to the brink. The first season got mixed reviews, withsome critics notingit suffered from  comparison with The White Lotus. But others praised the performances, with this season's cast also including Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians), Lena Olin (Alias) and Annie Murphy (Schitt's Creek). Pedro Sánchez warns against ""double standards"" after Russia was banned from the song contest in 2022. He will no longer present the corporation's future coverage of the FA Cup and World Cup as planned. The pop star performed in front of hundreds outside Sheffield Town Hall on Sunday. His years as a BBC host end in circumstances nobody would have wanted, but some might have predicted. The BBC will lose one of its highest-profile presenters when he stops hosting Match of the Day.

1021984,Olympic star 'broken' by top swim coach's regime,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4gmm2zv8no,"A world record-breaking swimmer has told BBC Panorama she was left ""broken"" by the harsh regime run by one of the UK's most successful swimming coaches. Rūta Meilutytė, who won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, said Jon Rudd's focus on weighing and swimmers' diets contributed to her struggle with an eating disorder and depression. In total, 12 ex-swimmers have told us they experienced bullying, a toxic training environment and controlling food culture at one of the UK's most prestigious clubs for young elite swimmers when he was head coach. Rudd had faced allegations of bullying and verbal abuse during his 28-year tenure at Plymouth Leander swimming club, but the BBC has learned that no action was taken by the sport's governing body. We have found that Swim England, the governing body, did not act on a confidential 2012 investigation which ruled Rudd should be suspended after hearing evidence about his behaviour from 17 witnesses. Swim England's new chief executive Andy Salmon said he did not know why Rudd had not been suspended, but he was ""deeply, deeply, sorry"" to Plymouth's swimmers and all of those harmed by the governing body's failings. Rudd, who is due to become high performance director of Saudi Arabia's Olympic swimming team, has not responded to the BBC. Plymouth Leander attracted aspiring swimmers from around the world after Rudd established its reputation as a club that produced Olympic athletes. While head coach between 1989 and 2017, he was responsible for swimmers' success, but also had safeguarding responsibilities to ensure their wellbeing. One of Plymouth Leander's most successful swimmers was Antony James,  who won silver at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and represented Team GB at the 2012 Olympics. He wasjailed for 21 years in February for raping two girls he had met at the club. Three people who trained at Plymouth Leander told Panorama that Rudd, who had coached James since he was eight years old, should have known he was interested in younger girls. A former girlfriend of James, also an ex-swimmer, said he was well known for mixing with young teenage girls and that his status as the club's ""golden boy"" meant no one questioned his behaviour. ""Everyone knew - he wasn't trying to hide anything that he was doing, it was very out there and open,"" she said. She was 16 and he was 22 when they started a relationship and she says she believes she was a ""gateway"" to his grooming of younger girls. Rudd was a coach at Plymouth Leander in 2010 when Lithuanian Rūta Meilutyte moved to the UK to be coached by him. She made Olympic history two years later when, aged 15, she became the youngest person to win the 100m breaststroke. Now 28, she recalls Rudd making cutting comments about her weight. When she confided in him that she had been making herself sick after meals to lose weight, she said he laughed and replied: ""Well, at least you get the calories out."" She said that Rudd did seek help for her once he realised that she was not happy with what he had said. She also described him saying her ""ass was fat"", moments before a major competition, aged 16. Despite being hailed as the club's most successful swimmer, Meilutytė said Rudd's regime ""made me for a while and then it broke me"". She left Plymouth Leander in 2017. Rudd's career, meanwhile, went from strength to strength, with him becoming Swim Ireland's director of performance swimming in the same year. Rudd was employed by Plymouth College, an independent school, until 2017. It ran a partnership with Plymouth Leander between 2001-2024 and many swimmers boarded there. Among the other 11 swimmers to make allegations to Panorama about Rudd was Olympic bronze medallist Cassie Patten. She said the coach had made her train with an injured shoulder and that it eventually ended her career in 2011. Commonwealth Youth gold medallist Phoebe Lenderyou told Panorama Rudd's regime aggravated her eating disorder. Andy Salmon, who has been CEO of Swim England since February 2024, confirmed to the BBC that no action was taken against Rudd despite evidence swimmers had suffered harm and the 2012 report's recommendation that he be suspended for four months. The report would have remained a secret but for the BBC receiving a tip-off in 2023. It said Rudd had been subjected to a lengthy probe, but that none of the complainants had been told the outcome. His case was reviewed after the BBC asked Swim England about it. According to the original investigation, Rudd's assistant coach, Lindsay Trimmings, should also have been suspended from Plymouth Leander. She was later hired by Swim England to be its head of coaching but left in 2023. When Panorama wrote to her, she said she did not want to respond. ""Clearly the organisation failed to act on the independent recommendations made at the time. And I'm really sorry, on behalf of Swim England, for any suffering that that might have led to,"" Mr Salmon told us. The failings of the 2012 investigation into Rudd have led to the governing body announcingit would review 1,500 safeguarding cases carried out across England between 2002 and 2022. Swim England commissioned a listening report into all aquatic sportsafter the BBC first shared multiple swimmers' accounts of mistreatmentin 2023. Published in 2024, the governing body's report found a culture of fear at all levels of the sport that threatened its future. Plymouth Leander said it was ""deeply concerned by the nature and severity"" of Panorama's allegations, stating that the club was ""fundamentally different"" from when Rudd was in charge. It also said it had conducted a ""thorough review"" of its safeguarding policies and procedures to provide ""the safest possible environment"". It said Rudd's employer, Plymouth College, was responsible for his ""oversight and jurisdiction"". Plymouth College, which is now under different ownership, said the club was responsible for safeguarding and that it was ""deeply concerned to hear these testimonies from swimmers who trained at Plymouth Leander"". It said the partnership with Plymouth Leander had been terminated and it now ran its own swimming organisation, Plymouth College Aquatics (PCA). BBC Panorama has also found evidence of a bullying culture at Royal Wolverhampton School Swimming Club, another leading institution in the sport, as recently as last year. Complaints about the behaviour of David Painter, the club's head coach at the time were made by the parents of 11 swimmers, during 2023 and 2024. One of the swimmers, Abby, now 17, told the BBC she was forced to choose between her education and swimming because Painter would not let her have time off to prepare for her GCSEs. She attended a different school several miles away but said she was told she would still have to train on the morning of exams. ""Towards the end I was literally having full blown panic attacks,"" said Abby, who told Panorama she was failing at school. She eventually decided to leave the sport. Alison Hickman, the club's former welfare officer, told the BBC she had given the names of 11 parents who had concerns about Painter to Swim England and said none of them were contacted by the governing body. Swim England told the BBC it had asked the school to resolve the issues. The Royal Wolverhampton School said complaints were confidential. It said the school has ""clear safeguarding procedures"" and ""all formal complaints are investigated swiftly and appropriately"". Painter, who left to coach in Canada last year, said his ""commitment to athlete development and wellbeing has always been at the core"" of his coaching, and that he had never been subject to ""any disciplinary investigations or hearings"". He added that the allegations against him were ""untrue… and defamatory"". Food writer Becky Excell says creating recipes helped her regain a positive relationship with food. The Derby-based charity hopes to increase capacity by a third in two years. Louisa Abbott, from Hampshire, says health and nutrition content was ""very dangerous"" for her. Tia Ainsworth's eating disorder left her too weak to exercise - now she's helping others to weight train.

326321,Alleged Iranian spies charged with targeting UK-based journalists,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04eze3wv5go,"Three alleged Iranian spies have appeared in court charged with targeting UK-based journalists so that ""serious violence"" could be inflicted on them. Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, all from London, appeared in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court. They are accused of targeting individual journalists working for Iran International, an independent media organisation based in London. The three defendants were granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum. They arrived in the UK between 2016 and 2022. Mr Sepahvand arrived in 2016 concealed in a lorry. The other two arrived in small boats. The three men are charged with committing offences under the National Security Act between 2024 and this year. They were arrested two weeks ago. They are charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, namely that of Iran, in carrying out UK-related activities and knew or ought to have reasonably known their conduct was likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. ""Iran must be held to account for its actions,"" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement following Saturday's charges. She added: ""We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil."" Mr Sepahvand, of St John's Wood, London is also charged with engaging in surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research with the intention of committing serious violence against a person in the UK. Mr Manesh, of Kensal Rise, London and Mr Noori, of Ealing, London are also charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance with the intention that serious violence against a person in the UK would be committed by others. A fourth man, 31, was arrested on 9 May as part of the investigation but was released without charge on Thursday, police said. It is alleged the three men carried out surveillance with a view to locating journalists associated with Iran International. Iran International produces coverage that is critical of the current regime in Iran and has been proscribed in Iran as a terrorist organisation. The three defendants appeared in the dock wearing grey tracksuits flanked by eight guards. Mr Sepahvand was in a wheelchair. No pleas were indicated by the men. District Judge Annabel Pilling remanded them in custody to appear the Old Bailey on 6 June. Cdr Dominic Murphy, from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said the ""extremely serious"" charges made on Saturday come follow ""a very complex and fast-moving investigation"". He said detectives had been ""working around the clock"" since the men were arrested, and added that officers had been ""in contact with the individuals directly affected"". Frank Ferguson, head of the CPS special crime and counter terrorism division, said: ""It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."" The arrest of the three men on 3 May came on the same day that five other Iranian men were detained in London, Swindon, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester by police as part of a separate counter-terrorism investigation. Four were released from custody on Saturday, with the fifth previously released on bail until an unspecified date in May. Cdr Murphy said ""our investigation remains active and ongoing"". The police stressed that they were not treating the two investigations as linked. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says there's been a rise in Iran-linked operations on UK soil. Organised gangs are paid to carry out attacks and kidnappings, evidence uncovered by the BBC reveals. Speaking in Qatar, the US President said that Iran has ""sort of"" agreed to the terms of a deal. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi described the negotiations as ""difficult but useful"". Wiltshire Police's PCC warns that sharing unverified information can hinder the work of officers.

161902,Elton John brands government 'losers' over AI copyright plans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg0348yvxo,"Sir Elton John described the government as ""absolute losers"" and said he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws. Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"". This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes. A government spokesperson said that ""no changes"" to copyright laws would be ""considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators"". Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. Sir Elton said the ""danger"" is that, for young artists, ""they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]"". ""It's criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed,"" he added. ""The House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour,"" he said. ""The government just looked at it as if to say, 'Hmm, well the old people ... like me can afford it.'"" On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used. But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"", adding that he thought the government was ""just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it"". The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to ""wise up"" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as ""a bit of a moron"". He said if the government does not change its plans, he would be ready to take ministers to court, saying that ""we'll fight it all the way"". Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers ""do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way"". The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is ""on the brink"" of offering up the country's music industry ""as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants"". He added that the prime minister ""must not sell"" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators ""down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work"". Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joinedmore than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright lawsin a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter,previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a ""Wild West""in which artists' copyright was not properly protected. A government spokesperson said it wants the UK's creative industries and AI companies to ""flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors"". The spokesperson said it was ""vital"" the government worked through responses to a consultation on proposals to allow developers to use creators' content unless rights holders elected to ""opt out"". They added that it was ""equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps"". ""That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment - exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.""

119898,"UK needs more nuclear to power AI, says Amazon boss",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd5014wpno,"The UK needs more nuclear energy to power the data centres needed for artificial intelligence (AI), the boss of the world's largest cloud computing company has said. Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, plans to spend £8bn on new data centres in the UK over the next four years. A data centre is a warehouse filled with computers that remotely power services such as AI, data processing, and streaming, but a single one can use the same amount of energy as a small town. Matt Garman, chief executive of AWS, told the BBC nuclear is a ""great solution"" to data centres' energy needs as ""an excellent source of zero carbon, 24/7 power"". AWS is the single largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world and has funded more than 40 renewable solar and wind farm projects in the UK. The UK's 500 data centres currently consume 2.5% of all electricity in the UK, while Ireland's 80 hoover up 21% of the country's total power, with those numbers projected to hit 6% and 30% respectively by 2030. The body that runs the UK's power grid estimates that by 2050 data centres alone will use nearly as much energy as all industrial users consume today. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Matt Garman said that future energy needs were central to AWS planning process. ""It's something we plan many years out,"" he said. ""We invest ahead. I think the world is going to have to build new technologies. I believe nuclear is a big part of that particularly as we look 10 years out."" French company EDF is currently building a giant new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset and a decision to build another one at Sizewell in Suffolk is pending. EDF's UK Chair Alex Chisholm unsurprisingly agrees with Mr Garman. ""Why are data centre providers turning to nuclear? They will need a lot of energy, reliably,"" Mr Chisholm told the BBC. ""Replication of Hinkley Point C, alongside the roll out of SMRs, can power Britain's digital economy."" SMRs refers to small modular reactors which are the size of a football stadium as opposed to the size of a whole town, like Sizewell or Hinkley. Amazon is already partnering with SMR firms in Washington and Virginia to develop SMRs and would be a natural customer for Rolls Royce which is developing its own SMR designs here. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that modular reactors ""will play a particularly important roles in growing energy-hungry sectors like AI and we're shaking up the planning rules to make it easier to build nuclear power stations across the country"" But this technology is many years away and new grid connections already take years to establish. Jess Ralston at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: ""Investors can be waiting years for grid connections holding back growth."" ""Nuclear could be a way of supply data centre's power needs, but hardly any SMRs have been built anywhere in the world and traditional nuclear remains very expensive and takes a long time to build. So, it may be a while, if ever, for this to be a viable solution"". AWS estimates that 52% of businesses are using AI in some way – with a new business adopting it at a rate of one a minute. Mr Garman said this is a good thing. ""AI is one of the most transformative technologies since the internet. It's going to have a significant effect on almost every part of our lives."" He said he understands why many are nervous. ""With any technology that is sufficiently new or hard to understand, people are probably appropriately scared of it initially, until they better understand it so that initial response is not particularly surprising."" He added that he ""would caution against"" international regulation. ""The technology is moving at such a rate that I don't believe there's the knowledge of the folks that are building those regulations are going to be able to keep up. ""I think the most likely case is that those regulations would accomplish the exact inverse thing they are trying to do."" However, he admitted he thinks a lot about the responsibility of releasing AI into the world. ""Anytime you're building that much of a transformational technology, its important to think about those controls and guardrails so that it can go towards the betterment of society not the detriment. ""So absolutely. I think a ton about that, for sure."" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

189490,Mexico accuses MrBeast of exploiting Mayan pyramids,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr70vykk0wo,"Mexico is seeking compensation from the producers of a MrBeast video and has accused the US YouTuber of exploiting its ancient pyramids for commercial gain. The video ""I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples"" shows the influencer, real name Jimmy Donaldson, 27, and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit. But in one part of the video produced by Full Circle Media, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week, MrBeast advertises a  chocolate product as a ""Mayan dessert"" and urges viewers to buy it. Authorities said that while they had granted permission to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations. The spokesperson told the BBC: ""No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History)."" In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site. The spokesperson also said the video was ""meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico"" and that it was ""unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures"". Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted. In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product. The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá. At one point he says ""I can't believe the government's letting us do this."" They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask. But heritage authorities said these were ""false assertions"" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene. ""All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,"" its statement on Monday read. Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising. ""We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation,"" she said. She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the ""knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage"" it was firmly against those who ""take advantage of the willingness of institutions"". She said INAH would consider ""administrative sanctions"" against Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm. MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May.

372369,M&S hackers believed to have gained access through third party,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqe213vw3po,"The hackers behind a cyber-attack on Marks & Spencer (M&S) managed to gain entry through a third party who had access to its systems, the BBC understands. The cyber-attack, which happened in April, has caused millions of pounds of lost sales for M&S and left it struggling to get services back to normal, with online orders paused for more than three weeks. The supermarket declined to comment on the nature of the breach or these new details, saying ""availability is now in a much more normal place with stores well stocked this weekend"". DragonForce - the name the criminals are using - previously told the BBC it was behind the attack and was alsoresponsible for hacking the Co-opandan attempted hack on Harrods. M&S will announce its annual results on Wednesday, but the focus will all be on the devastating attack and its financial impact. Bank of America analysts believe M&S has lost more than £40m of sales every week since the incident began over the Easter bank holiday weekend. It announced on 25 April it had stopped taking online orders. Some stores were left with empty food shelves after the firm had to take some food-related systems offline. On a precautionary basis, M&S decided to close down many of its IT operations following the attack, effectively locking itself out its core systems as it grappled to deal with the attack. The biggest challenge is getting its online system fully operational again, which accounts for around a third of its clothing and homeware sales. M&S told the BBC: ""Our stores have remained open and availability is now in a much more normal place with stores well stocked this weekend."" The retailer said on 13 May thatsome personal customer data was stolen in the cyber attack, which could include names, date of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, household information, and online order histories. It added that any card information taken would not be useable as it does not hold full card payment details on its systems. The Co-op, which the hackers previously told the BBC they had targeted, said on 30 April that it hadshut down parts of its IT systems in response to the attack.The hack caused payment problems and widespread shortages of goods in shops, and customer and staff data was compromised. It said on Wednesday that customers should seestocks return to more normal levels on Saturday and Sunday. The High Street chain is trialling moving its self-serve goods to crack down on shoplifting.

108287,LA 2028 Olympics plans air taxi service for spectators,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnp103zr9o,"Spectators could fly through the Los Angeles skies and escape the city's notorious traffic during the 2028 Olympic Games if the organisers have their way. LA28, the committee charged with planning the city's third Summer Games, have announced a partnership with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The company says it plans to use a fleet of aircraft to ferry fans to and from venues, LA28 announced on Thursday. Flying taxis have been a longstanding dream. They were planned to debut in the Paris Games in 2024, but were not certified by Europe's air safety agency in time. Similarly, Archer Aviation has not yet been certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration, meaning the aircraft are not ready yet for commercial use. It's founder and CEO has said he hoped to have that key signoff - a Type Certification that says it meets design and safety standards - by the aviation regulator this year. If they receive certification in time for the 2028 Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region. It is unclear how much each trip would cost, but Archer Aviation's founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said he wants to keep prices comparable to a high-end Uber, according to the Los Angeles Times. Like the popular ride-hailing service, customers would be able to request an air taxi through an app. The aircraft can carry up to four people and operates similarly to a helicopter in its take-offs and landings. The piloted Midnight aircraft is part of a family of vehicles called ""eVTOLs"" - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Archer is among several eVTOL makers seeking to change travel in congested urban cities by offering short-haul air travel. The industry has seen many hurdles, including battery density, and none of the aircraft have yet been approved by the FAA. Archer's Midnight aircraft is built with 12 engines and propellers, and produces ""less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter"", according to LA28. Archer Aviation hopes it will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ""at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners"". ""We want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America,"" Mr Goldstein said in a statement. ""There's no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games."" Safety, regulations and investment have proved a big hurdle for companies trying to introduce flying taxis. Despite the setbacks and delays, many still believe they could be the future of transportation. Archer Aviation remains confident its aircraft can buck recent trends, and sees the 2028 Olympics as a way to introduce them to the world. The UK government announced the Future of Flight action plan in 2024, predicting that the first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and become a regular sight in the skies. Los Angeles has previously hosted the Olympics in 1984 and 1932, making this the third time the city has hosted the Summer Games. The city has announced the 2028 Games will not allow cars, a tall order after plans were nixed to expand the area's transit system. Bert and Herman Volk are responsible for creating planes and early flights from the sea at Brighton. A BBC reporter's trip to Madrid was going smoothly until she landed and things unravelled. The commitment from the state-owned airline comes as Boeing pushes to rebuild its business. The agreement will cover both inbound and outbound passengers. The government is accused of ignoring advice to reject the plans over environmental concerns. Copyright 2025 BBC.

455221,Trump signs bill combating deepfakes and revenge porn,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74qnyz89y3o,"US President Donald Trump has signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called ""revenge porn"" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalises posting ""intimate images"" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. While the bill has received strong bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say  it's too broad and could lead to censorship. The bill is the sixth piece of legislation Trump has signed in his second term, with the president often preferring to enact his agenda through Executive Orders. The president signed the bill on Monday afternoon at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, after it was passed by both houses of Congress. He was accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, who White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previously said was ""instrumental"" in getting the bill through Congress. It cleared the lower chamber of Congress in a 409-2 vote at the end of April, and was unanimously passed by the Senate in February. Melania Trump has championed the bill since her husband began his second term. In March, she used her first solo public appearance to urge members of Congress to pass the bill. ""It's heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes,"" the first lady said during a roundtable discussing the bill on 3 March. ""In an era where digital interaction are integral to daily life, it is imperative that we safeguard children from mean-spirited and hurtful online behaviour."" Revenge porn is sharing an intimate image without consent. Deepfake porn involves creating, often using AI, a fake explicit image or video of a person. Use of the technology has grown in recent years, allowing users to add the faces of celebrities or public figures - most often women - into pornographic films. Tech companies including Meta, TikTok and Google supported the legislation. But it's not without critics. Advocates for digital rights and free speech say it could lead to the censorship of legitimate content, including legal pornography, LGBTQ+ content, and government criticism. ""While protecting victims of these heinous privacy invasions is a legitimate goal, good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy,"" digital rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation said. ""As currently drafted, the Act mandates a notice-and-takedown system that threatens free expression, user privacy, and due process, without addressing the problem it claims to solve."" The Internet Society, which advocates for digital privacy on the internet, says it poses ""unacceptable risks to users' fundamental privacy rights and cybersecurity by undermining encryption"".

693014,Peers demand more protection from AI for creatives,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39xj284e14o,"The House of Lords has dealt a second defeat to the government over its Data (Use and Access) Bill. Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once. MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to ""piecemeal"" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright. However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the ""whisperings of Silicon Valley"" asking them to ""redefine theft"". The Lords rebellion followscondemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government ""losers"" over the weekend and said ministers would be ""committing theft"" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying. He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material. Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work. Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans ""extraordinary"". ""There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,"" she said. ""The government has got it wrong. ""They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output. ""Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen."" Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was ""the minimum viable action from the government"" to signal that ""UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land"". Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a ""political gesture"" ignoring ""widespread theft"" of UK copyright and ""starving"" the creative industry of ""the transparency they need to survive"". She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up ""a double standard"" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright. ""This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,"" he said. ""I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else."" Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed ""the clarion cry of this country's creators"". A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to ""protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech"" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as ""taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI"". The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation ""burglary"". ""The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,"" he said. ""If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries."" Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had ""slogged away, struggled and suffered"" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her ""tenacity and dogged determination"" to ensure ""creativity will not be stolen"". Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting ""this isn't about Silicon Valley"", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that ""no other territory has cracked this either"". ""We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,"" she said. ""Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments... ""Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world."" However, Kidron said her amendment ""does not challenge the primacy of the Commons"" and pushed ahead. The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.

845746,Struggling DNA testing firm 23andMe to be bought for $256m,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln0e5g6kgo,"The DNA testing firm 23andMe says it has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256m (£192m). It comes two months after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. 23andMe said Regeneron had committed to comply with its privacy policies as part of the deal, and that Regeneron has security controls in place to protect user data. Last month, the firm agreed to have an ombudsman oversee the protection of user data in response to demands by several state attorneys general in the US. The officials expressed concern over the potential for unscrupulous buyers to wield the data against consumers. Regeneron will acquire nearly all of 23andMe's assets,the company said in a statement. Its subsidiary Lemonaid Health will be wound down under the agreement. 23andMe will continue to operate as a wholly-owned unit unit of Regeneron, which said it would use the firm's data for drug development. ""We are pleased to have reached a transaction that maximizes the value of the business and enables the mission of 23andMe to live on, while maintaining critical protections around customer privacy, choice and consent with respect to their genetic data,"" said 23andMe's board chairman Mark Jensen. The deal was made through auction last week as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. The company declined to comment further when approached by the BBC. Regeneron has different aims from the ones 23andMe presented to consumers, according to Dr Jennifer King, privacy and data policy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Dr. King, who has interviewed multiple 23andMe users for her research, said the company ""always led with the non-profit 'we're helping humanity' side which helped obscure its for-profit mission"". But she added a profit-driven mission was likely to be clearer to customersnow that it ""is in the sole control of a company that is doing genetic research for pharmaceutical development"". 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki who served as CEO until stepping down in March. Over the years, the company received high-profile endorsements from celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Snoop Dogg. 23andMe went public in 2021, which saw its value top $6bn - but it never turned a profit. The once-celebrated company has struggled amid weak demand for its testing kits and never managed to redefine its business model. A subscription service failed to gain traction with customers and efforts to use its massive trove of data to move into drug development also faltered. Then in 2023 the company experienced a data breach that exposed the genetic data of millions of users. The firm ultimately settled a lawsuit alleging it failed to protect the privacy of nearly seven million customers whose personal information was exposed. Hackers gained access to family trees, birth years and geographic locations, by using customers' old passwords, but the company maintains the data stolen did not include DNA records. Two months after the settlement, it slashed 200 jobs - about 40% of its workforce. Ms Wojcicki tried to take the company private but was not open to a third-party takeover. When 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March, attorneys general from multiple US states advised its customers to purge their information from the firm's database. At the time, the company said it would continue to protect customer data as laid out in its privacy policy, and any buyer of the company would have to abide by laws that apply to how customer data is treated. But its privacy policy also included language which allowed for personal information to be accessed, sold, or transferred if it was ""involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets"". 23andMe agreed to a court-appointed overseer of customer genetic data after several states alleged the company was failing to take data security seriously enough.

477050,AI and cyber attack centre will be 'leading force',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2xrw5jl8o,"A university's new centre looking at the global rise in cyber attacks and artificial intelligence (AI) will be a leading force in the field, its director says. The Centre for Cyber Resilience and Artificial Intelligence (CYBRAI) opened at Wolverhampton University on Friday. It will focus on research into limiting cyber attacks and the growth in AI, bringing together academia, industry, and government to tackle the evolving digital challenges. Director Prof Zeeshan Pervez said the centre was the first to bring the two fields together. A team of 20 academics will work at the university -itself the victim of a cyber attack in 2024- looking at strengthening the recovery process after a business or operation suffers a cyber attack. They will also monitor and research the growing role of AI in innovation and managing any threats. ""Cyber attacks will keep on happening -  that's what we have seen in the case of Marks and Spencer and the Co-Op - that the attacks will happen,"" Mr Pervez said. ""But it's all about how quickly you can recover from those attacks."" He said researchers at the centre would try to ""reduce the collateral damage"" caused by system breaches. ""If they are able to get in, how we can stop them and how we can make sure our systems are secure from from that point on,"" he said. The Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 stated 43% of businesses and 30% of charities experienced a cyber-security breach or attack in the last 12 months. A National Audit Office (NAO) report in January said there were ""substantial gaps in cyber-resilience"" in 58 critical government IT systems. ""In Europe there's a significant rise of a 35% increase in cyber attacks on organisations - they are approximately facing 1,300 attacks on a weekly basis per organisation in the EU,"" Mr Pervez added. The centre's work on AI would also be crucial given its fast-moving nature, he said. ""Radio took 38 years to reach 50 million users, television took 13 years and Facebook took one year to reach 50 million users and ChatGPT took two months to reach 100 million users,"" he said. ""AI is powering the digital transformation."" Being based in Wolverhampton complimented a growing number of IT and cyber-security firms in the West Midlands, Mr Pervez said, adding the centre was unique in the UK for its joined-up approach in the two fields. ""Our niche is that we are bringing both of them under one umbrella because they go hand in hand with each other."" Follow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

482931,Workers optimistic but overwhelmed by AI - study,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpx1rl2nlo,"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workplace is both game-changing and overwhelming for UK workers, a study has found. More than 4,500 people from almost 30 different employment sectors were polled as part of the research, which was commissioned by Henley Business School. It found that 56% of full-time professionals were optimistic about AI advancements, while 61% said they were overwhelmed by the speed at which the technology developed. Prof Keiichi Nakata, from Henley Business School, said the study showed many workers ""don't feel equipped"" to use AI. Prof Nakata is director of AI at The World of Work Institute at the school, which is part of the University of Reading, and helps organisations get to grips with the technology. ""This wide-scale study offers a valuable snapshot of how AI is being adopted across UK industries - and where support is still lacking,"" he said. ""Without in-house training, hands-on learning, and clear policies, we risk creating a workforce that's willing to use AI but is not sure where to start."" The study found that three in five people polled said they would be more likely to use AI at work if proper training were available. But nearly a quarter of respondents said their employers currently were not providing enough support. Prof Nakata said the technology ""could be a transformative change in organisations across the UK"". He said AI could ""simplify complex tasks, take away the boring jobs, and enable workers to have more time to focus on the things that really matter"". ""But that's just the tip of the iceberg; it could prove to be a solution that not only helps businesses thrive but improves work satisfaction for employees,"" he added.

665481,UK weather forecast more accurate with Met Office supercomputer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg4ygerpjo,"The Met Office has unveiled a new supercomputer which it says produces better forecasts. The weather agency says detailed estimates up to 14 days in advance will become the norm, while rainfall predictions will also be more accurate. The new cloud-based system, which was launched on Monday, can perform 60 quadrillion calculations per second. It is being operated by Microsoft's cloud-based Azure, making it the first system the Met Office is not running by itself. And it ends a long wait for the weather prediction tech,which was first announced in 2020and originally slated for 2022. According to the Met Office, this is the world's first cloud-based supercomputer dedicated to weather and climate science. It said one of the benefits of the tech will be improving forecasting at airports, while it could also give the energy sector more detailed information to help it plan for potential blackouts and surges. And it said the supercomputer, which is entirely powered by renewable energy, will also improve predications on ongoing challenges caused by climate change, such as flooding and wildfires. The new supercomputer, which can perform more than four times the number of calculations per second than its predecessor, contains 1.8m core processors. While the exact location of the infrastructure is a secret, the Azure supercomputing service is physically located in the south of England and is split across two data centres. Afterrecent hacks of British institutionssuch as M&S and Co-op, cyber security is on ""everyone's thoughts"" according to the Met Office's chief information officer Charles Ewen. But he said he is happy with the security of the new system and is ""very confident this is a big enhancement"" on its predecessor. ""There's never been a more critical time for weather and climate intelligence,"" said Prof Simon Vosper, the Met Office's science director. ""We know the climate's changing, as we know the risks of hazardous weather. ""The supercomputer will unlock our ability to deliver those improved services where they're needed."" In February 2020, the UK governmentpledged £1.2bn for the projectand said the old supercomputers would reach the end of their lives in 2022. Mr Ewen said the three-year delay was predominantly caused by the Covid pandemic and its impact on the availability of silicon, while the Met Office highlighted the need to keep delivering existing services during the changeover. ""I'm very confident the Met Office is best placed in the world to be able to accommodate at scale emerging methods and techniques such as artificial intelligence,"" he said. Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service is one of the largest providers of data centres in the world, and powers a large part of artificial intelligence infrastructure.

694607,US loses last perfect credit rating amid rising debt,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o,"The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt. In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs. A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts. Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917. The downgrade ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said in the statement. In a statement, the White House said it was ""focused on fixing Biden's mess"", while taking a swipe at Moody's. ""If Moody's had any credibility,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded."" A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs. Moody's maintained that the US ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency"". The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country. The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment.

Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it.

1002584,Starmer banks on public being over Brexit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2r4n871xo,"This is undeniably a significant deal. In a funny way, though, for Sir Keir Starmer to succeed he needs it to seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible. For many in politics, wading through the details of this agreement will be an act of nostalgia – or perhaps deeply triggering. Dynamic alignment. Sanitary and phytosanitary checks. Fishing quotas. Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. These are concepts, institutions and trade-offs which came to dominate British politics for much of the past decade. And with good reason: as the UK navigated its divorce with the EU, these technical questions became deeply political as they shaped the post-Brexit relationship. Sir Keir's big bet is that nobody really cares any more. In the press conference with EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, the prime minister talked about moving on from the ""stale old debates"" of the Brexit years. It's worth remembering too that the 2016 referendum was not the only political mandate delivered on this issue, and that Labour's general election manifesto last year promised an ""improvement"" to the Brexit deal. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union – but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. Of course pragmatism lies in the eyes of the beholder. The Conservatives have lambasted the deal as ""surrender"", attacking both the 12-year extension to existing fishing quotas and the commitment for the UK to follow EU rules on agriculture. Reform UK, in many ways the successor to the Brexit Party and UKIP, are unsurprisingly making a similar argument. On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed ""some positive first steps"" but urged the prime minister to ""be more ambitious"". Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods. What will prove revealing over the coming days, weeks, and months is not just those opposition parties' positions but how much they campaign on them. If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU. If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life. But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.

952255,Billionaires fall as King rises in latest Sunday Times Rich List,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lnzx73pl3o,"The number of UK billionaires has fallen while King Charles' personal wealth has jumped to equal that of former prime minister Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty, according tothe latest Sunday Times Rich List. The annual list of the UK's 350 richest people revealed the biggest decline in billionaires in the paper's history. Meanwhile in the past year, the King's wealth has grown by £30m to £640m, increasing his rank 20 places to 238 with Sunak and Murty. Topping the list for the fourth consecutive year is the Hinduja family behind the Indian corporation Hinduja Group, which, despite a decline in fortune, is recorded to be worth more than £35bn. The number of billionaires slid to 156 this year from 165 in 2024, representing the sharpest decline in the Sunday Times Rich List's 37-year-history. ""Our billionaire count is down and the combined wealth of those who feature in our research is falling,"" Robert Watts, compiler of the Rich List told PA Media. 1. Gopi Hinduja and family (£35.3bn, down from £37.2bn) 2. David and Simon Reuben and family (£26.87bn) 3. Sir Leonard Blavatnik (£25.73bn) 4. Sir James Dyson and family (£20.8bn) 5. Idan Ofer (£20.12bn) Coming in second after the Hinduja family, at almost £27bn, were the Reuben brothers, who made their fortune through property and technology. A close third was Sir Leonard Blavatnik, a Ukrainian born British-American businessman who built up a sizeable net worth of almost £26bn. Seeing the biggest fall in fortune this yearwas Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. His wealth has dropped by £6.473bn - more than a quarter of his fortune - in the last year. It now sits at £17.046bn from £23.519bn, pushing him from fourth to seventh on the list. Among other notable figures to make the list were Formula One champion Sir Lewis Hamilton, David and Victoria Beckham, and Sir Elton John. Dua Lipa, 29, was the youngest person to be included on the sub-list of the richest Britons aged under 40. She was ranked at 34, with an estimated wealth of £115m. Harry Styles, 31, was listed at 22 with a fortune of £225m. Ed Sheeran, 34, was at number 13 with £370m. The King's rise in wealth has also made him richer than his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The new figures estimate Charles to be worth £270m more than his mother, with the majority of his fortune benefiting from the investment portfolio he inherited from her. The late Queen was said to be worth £370m in 2022 compared to Charles' current fortune of £640m. He did not pay inheritance tax on the fortune she left, due to an exemption. This would have charged a standard of 40% on assets above a threshold. Money is also earned from the private estate the Duchy of Lancaster. It covers more than 18,000 hectares of land in areas such as Lancashire and Yorkshire, as well as property in central London. Worth £654m, it generates about £20m a year in profits. Mr Watts said researchers found that fewer ""of the world's super rich are coming to live in the UK."" He said he was ""struck by the strength of criticism for Rachel Reeves's Treasury"" when speaking to wealthy individuals for the publication. He said: ""We expected the abolition of non-dom status would anger affluent people from overseas. The Labour government abolished the non-dom tax status in April, which is where UK residents whose permanent home or domicile is outside the UK for tax purposes. Instead, they now face the new foreign income and gains regime, which provides tax relief on foreign income and gains for people in their first four years of tax residence. It only applies if they have not been a tax resident in the UK in any of the 10 consecutive years prior to their arrival. Last year, former Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt revealed plans to scrap the tax status before successor Rachel Reeves sped up the process. The government expects the package of measures to raise £12.7bn over the next five years. US President Donald Trump's global tariffs, announced in April, have also had an impact. The announcement saw the stock markets plummet immediately afterwards, with turbulence continuing since and businesses facing higher prices in the US. The International Monetary Fund hassaid in its recent forecast for the world economythat global share prices dropped ""as trade tensions flared"" and warned about an ""erosion of trust"" between countries.

King Charles and Queen Camilla will host Emmanuel Macron and his wife at Windsor Castle in July. A UK attempt to butter up the French leader, perhaps? ""It'll be interesting to see if they can agree common language [for a summit agreement],"" says Georgina Wright, Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund. ""Everyone in the EU wants closer relations with the UK right now and France doesn't want to be seen as the one country blocking closer UK-EU cooperation. But that does not mean that Paris is willing to give up on core interests."" Interests like fishing rights in UK waters and bidding for EU defence contracts. Negotiating - or to be more accurate - haggling over the ""meat"" of the summit will, I'm told, continue till the last moment. On the day itself, we can expect three separate announcements: These trade measures are the ""reset"" of relations with the EU that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised since his party won a general election last summer. They are far from an economic gamechanger for the UK, though. Hardly what you'd call ambitious. Destroying all trade barriers with the EU is impossible if the Labour government keeps to its own ""red lines"" of not rejoining the bloc's customs union or single market. Despite promising to prioritise UK economic growth, and polls suggesting the majority of Britons want to do more trade with the EU, Labour will feel hemmed in by the increasingly popular, Eurosceptic Reform Party. Itperformed well in recent local electionsin the UK. While some in Labour (quietly) admit they are tempted by a customs union with the EU to boost growth, any economic benefits would likely not be apparent to voters before the next UK election. Party members fear they would risk being punished at the polls, amidst accusations by the opposition Conservatives and Reform that the government would have betrayed Brexit. These concerns make the Starmer government ""more cautious, less bold"", says Mr Menon. The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach to try to reduce costly trade barriers with the EU. Many EU-UK negotiating hours have gone into agreeing a plant and animal health deal, known as an SPS agreement. This will facilitate the export and import of meat and plant products between the EU and UK and help reduce post-Brexit trade complications between Northern Ireland and Britain. In exchange, the EU insists the UK must agree to following any new SPS rules introduced in the future and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in policing the agreement. Those conditions will likely be unpopular with ardent Brexit supporters. They might also put backs up in Washington andcomplicate the UK doing a wider future deal on agriculture with the US,as the UK would be tied to stringent EU standards. But the Labour government knows public opinion polls suggest most people in the UK prioritise trade with the EU over the US. Currently the EU counts for 41% of UK exports; the US for 21%. The UK government will probably insist the SPS agreement is good for the British economy. Though animal and plant exports and imports are, in fact, a small part of overall GDP. In reality ""growth is a bit of a red herring here"", says Mr Menon. On the EU side, the French, backed by other fishing nations like the Netherlands and Denmark, have taken a tough stance in these talks - refusing to sign up unless the UK agrees to long-term EU fishing rights in UK waters. The current post-Brexit fishing agreement expires next year. The reset we'll hear about at Monday's summit will also include a ""mobility"" section. Starmer will get his ask, for the EU to recognise UK professional qualifications, to encourage cross-border business. There will also be a reduction in visa restrictions for UK musicians travelling and performing in the EU. In exchange, the EU - and Germany, most passionately -wants a youth mobility scheme,allowing young EU citizens to travel, study, and even work in the UK. The UK has similar schemes with Canada, Australia, South Korea and Japan, amongst others. But this has been tricky to agree. Reducing migration figures is a number one priority for the Labour government. It's a hot-button issue and the UK Home Office will seek to toughen conditions and limit EU numbers. Negotiations are ongoing but, according to EU sources, the scheme already has a name: YES, or Youth Experience Scheme. Some areas of negotiation are more advanced than others. This will be reflected in Monday's announcement. There will also be talk at the summit of plans to tackle illegal migration, cooperate on carbon border taxes, and simplify energy trading between the EU and UK. Reducing EU-UK trade barriers on chemicals and pharmaceutical goods is also a UK ambition, as is getting access to EU databases, like the Schengen Information System, to better track down criminals. But for now, at least, the EU is saying no to that. If it makes an exception for the UK, other non-EU countries will demand the same, it insists. Of course, it's in the interest of both sides to fight cross-border crime. The UK argues the current state of the world calls for more flexible thinking from Brussels. The case for more flexible thinking is also something the UK is calling for when it comes to Monday's defence and security pact with the EU. The EU and UK already work closely together onRussian sanctions and defending Ukraine.And the pact isn't a legally binding document, so how complicated can these talks be, you may ask? The answer is pretty complicated. The UK wants its defence companies to be allowed to bid for contracts under the EU's new re-armament scheme, SAFE (Security Action for Europe). ""The UK has earned the right to access such a deal because of the leadership it's shown over Ukraine,"" says international defence expert Sophia Gaston, a visiting fellow at King's College London. ""Britain is a serious player both in traditional defence capabilities, like producing munitions, and in cutting edge defence innovation, where new growth and energy is. ""If the UK has access to the emerging EU defence programmes, it can contribute to mass and pace. [The war in Ukraine] has shown that both are needed."" But Ms Gaston admits, UK companies getting the go-ahead from Brussels is a ""messy"" process. ""Re-Arm EU"", as Brussels dubs its new drive, is still a work in progress, spurred by rapidly changing geopolitics, including fears the US will withdraw at least some of the crucial security support Europe has relied on since World War Two. This is not yet afully formed EU strategy that the UK can ""pay to play""a part in, as it has done post-Brexit with the EU's research and innovation scheme Horizon, for example. An agreement with the UK in this defence industrial context will be brand new and bespoke. And it's getting political. Signing the security pact on Monday is just a step in the process. France wants to severely restrict non-EU companies bidding for the bloc's defence contracts, including the UK but Canadian and American firms too. If the EU is spending its taxpayers' money on defence, it argues it should be spent with EU companies to help boost EU economies. Paris also says, in this rapidly changing world of shifting alliances and allegiances, the EU should be self-reliant, not dependent on suppliers outside the bloc. Sceptics suspect France,which has a sophisticated defence industry,of wanting to hoover up lucrative EU contracts for itself. But it looks like it is losing the internal EU argument, with the Nordics, the Baltics, Poland, Italy and the Netherlands favouring more openness on defence contracts, and particularly with the EU's biggest economic power, Germany, championing the UK. ""Germany and France have very different attitudes towards the UK,"" says German economist Armin Steinbach from think tank Bruegel. Germany will always put relations with EU heavyweights France and Poland first, says Mr Steinbach. But he believes the UK will be helped in defence and economic negotiations with the EU by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who argues ""a unified Europe is the absolute priority in the current geopolitical setting"". A priority maybe, but it's still a hugely tall order because it's all about compromise. Political leaders will seek to justify increases in defence spending by insisting to voters that it's for their personal security and in the interest of their national economy, with boosts in revenue for domestic defence industries. But achieving a pan-European industrial base - built to be efficient, avoid duplication, and to replace much of the US capacity relied on by the continent today - would mean some European countries winning more defence contracts than others. It would also mean some national businesses shutting down, in favour of better-suited ones elsewhere on the continent. That's a hard sell for political leaders facing their voters. As is another big trade-off: Big increases in defence spending will meangovernments have less money to spend on public services. The challenge for Europe is breathtaking. By comparison, Monday's symbolic EU-UK summit, may seem like a walk in the park. A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. The EU-UK trade deal has been praised as a ""leap foward"" and ""genuine progress"" by some of the UK's major business groups. A new deal extending access for EU boats in UK waters has been agreed as part of a wider softening of relations with the bloc.

234418,What one of America's most lively sporting events says about the economy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk0zq7kg5o,"A woman balancing a dozen cocktails on a tray atop her head inched carefully through the steadily building crowds and chaos on Saturday morning at the Pimlico Race Course clubhouse. ""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. ""Twenty dollars,"" she replied. Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two."" He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. ""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on."" His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin. On the other side of Pimlico – just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield – five thoroughbreds idled behind the  starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment. ""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said. One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question. In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to historic consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes. Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market. Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"".  But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases. But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remains unclear. Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015. Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs. ""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald. Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. University of Kansas economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling also could be a sign of economic distress. ""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said. ""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release."" Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"". He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government. Mr Walker planned to gamble – ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" – but a bit less than he might have in more certain times. ""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy – the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life."" At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents. ""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness. To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning. ""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said. The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about is the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many. The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica. But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield. ""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube."" Though Pimlico always had offerings for elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.) Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it. In his purple pants and every-colour-of-the-rainbow shirt, Mr De Rubin grew agitated as his luck began to unravel during the five-horse race. ""(Horse number five) is dead last. I don't think they're going to catch this,"" he said with growing animation, rattling the ice in his Black-Eyed Susan. He placed bets on horses one, three and five. ""Oh, (crap), the three horse. Here comes the one horse. Come on, one!"" In a span of about three minutes, the anticipation, anxiety, fear and hope all came crashing to an end. Mr De Rubin didn't win. But he didn't lose either. The even spread on the winning horse basically gave him back what he put into it. He compared the experience to today's seesaw stock market. ""Investing, and betting on horses, is gambling. You have ups and downs,"" he said. His stock portfolio has taken a wild downward spin through Trump's global tariff tit-for-tat. But recently it sprang back into the green and is up around 20%, he said. Unlike the horses, ""you can't watch the market. It'll give you a heart attack"", he advised. ""I have faith in Trump. He's a little crazy with it right now, but it'll all work out."" América Sánchez, 20, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, died when the tall ship lost power and drifted into the bridge. It said new buyers Regeneron had committed to protect user data as part of the deal. Amerah and James Taylor lost their new home and their wedding rings when the tornado hit. The former US president has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office says. The Vatican says a meeting between the new Pope and US vice-president was ""cordial"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

172370,Doom: One of gaming's oldest series reckons with the challenges of 2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gezq2q911o,"Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom. First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry. But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025. Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles. BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges. While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face. ""There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,"" says executive producer Marty Stratton. Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts. There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as ""forever games"". In the latestOnline Nation reportby UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P. Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher. Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can ""fit into those habits"". ""It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,"" he says. The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase. But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players. Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is. ""The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,"" he says. One way of doing this is by attracting new players. Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new ""Medieval sci-fi"" setting and altered gameplay style. ""We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,"" he says. The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages. ""In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,"" says Hugo. But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry. The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years. In 2010, a new game cost roughly £40 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time. If you take into account inflation (using thisBank of England tool), that would be about £60 in today's money. Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs £69.99 for a standard edition or almost £100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included. ""When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,"" says Marty. The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers. That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players. But Doom producer Marty argues that ""free"" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are ""no unknown expenses"" with a one-off purchase such as Doom. ""You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,"" he says. F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from ""microtransactions"" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds. Those costs can mount up, and arecent pollof 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about £22 a month on those transactions. That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a ""curated experience"" with ""replay value"". ""Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,"" he says. Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more ""fiddling with prices"" and surcharges ""to see what customers are willing to pay"" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases. ""Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,"" he says. Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at £14.99 a month. There'sevidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price. Game Pass players could pay a £34.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content. Rhys says we are likely to see more of these sorts of offers are aimed at ""superfans"" who want to keep up with the latest releases. For everyone else, waiting is an option. ""You can pick up the first 2016 Doom game for like £4 right now,"" says Rhys. Doom's makers, perhaps unsurprisingly, believe their latest is worth jumping into. ""We think about price when we're developing it - we obviously want the value to be there for players,"" says Marty. ""Ultimately, it's a market. Players will determine what they want to spend."" ""I think it's there's obviously still a place for a good, premium, highly polished, fun single-player game,"" adds Hugo. Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.

723943,The secretive US factory that lays bare the contradiction in Trump's America First plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj0zgzwxo,"Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world. The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips. It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC. Its Arizona facility ""Fab 21"" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing. They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products. But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world. President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. ""TSMC is the biggest there is,"" he has said. ""We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us."" This is one of the US president's regular refrains. TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (£75bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business. The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs. China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its ""Silicon Shield"", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk. China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy. He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world. Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. ""I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,"" he says. ""It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering."" Inside the ""Gowning Building"", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything. Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as ""4 nanometre chips"". ""This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,"" he explains. ""[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps."" If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers. TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful. Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence. It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of ""extreme ultraviolet (UV) light"". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called ""lithography"". The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona. These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors. The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed. ""Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,"" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. ""The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms."" Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life. Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies. He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim. Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act. On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying ""a future Made in America"". ""The semiconductor supply chain is global,"" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. ""There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly."" As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges. That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products. The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs. There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world. Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop ""non-Red"" supply chains to counter China. Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology.

853549,"UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9v28r7vlxo,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said it is time to move on from ""political fights"" about Brexit, as the UK and the European Union agreed to a major reset of relations. The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. The Conservatives and Reform UK have described the deal as a ""surrender"" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some ""positive first steps"" to rebuilding ties with Europe. The agreement was finalised late on Sunday, ahead of a summit involving EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in London on Monday. ""It's time to look forward,"" Sir Keir said at the summit. ""To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people. ""We're ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people's lives here at home."" At a news conference, European Commission President von der Leyen described the summit as a ""historic moment"" that was only possible ""thanks to the leadership"" of Sir Keir. ""We're turning a page,"" she said. ""We're opening a new chapter in our relationship."" The president said the deal would make ""a real difference to people in the UK and across our union"" at a time of global instability. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks. Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely, the government said. In return, the UK will give the EU access to its fishing waters until 2038 - a 12-year extension of arrangements already in place. One diplomatic source said it amounted to a rollover of the existing terms agreed as part of the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in 2019. The text of the deal says: ""We note the political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038 and extending energy cooperation on a continuous basis."" The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights, which gave EU boats continued access to UK waters, was set to expire at the end of June 2026. The UK government has also unveiled a £360m investment fund in coastal communities and the fishing industry. Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.4% of UK GDP, but British control over its fishing waters was a big issue in the Brexit campaign. Defending the agreement, Sir Keir said it would allow British fishing communities to ""sell more easily into the European market"" and give them ""stability over the long term"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the 12-year deal on access for European boats ""will be the end of the fishing industry"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister ""must ignore the naysayers and dinosaurs in Reform and the Conservative Party and be more ambitious in getting the best deal in the national interest"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said giving the EU access to British waters for 12 years ""was three times longer than the government wanted"". ""We're becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again,"" she said. The deal requires the UK to follow rules set by Brussels in areas covering food trade, emissions trading and potential co-operation in the electricity market. Known as dynamic alignment, this arrangement would mean the UK giving the European Court of Justice a role in any trading disputes. Ina post on X, Johnson said under this ""sell out of a deal the UK will have to accept EU law on a host of measures from food standards to emissions trading"". He said Sir Keir had agreed that the UK ""will once again be paying countless millions of pounds into EU coffers - for the privilege of becoming the non-voting punk of the EU Commission"". The prime minister's spokesperson said payments to the EU in relation to the deals on agricultural products and energy were ""not big"", but not did confirm the costs. The government said there was a difference between these ""administrative costs"" and the payments required to be part of EU programmes, which would be part of future negotiations. A security pact is also central to the agreement, as European nations come under pressure to invest more in defence to support Ukraine as it faces Russia's full-scale invasion. The agreement paves the way for the UK to participate in the EU's proposed new £150bn defence fund, opening up opportunities for UK arms firms to bid for defence contracts. The government said British businesses will not be hit by an EU carbon tax due to come in next year, under plans to link emissions-trading schemes. The agreements on trade and energy would add nearly £9bn to the UK economy by 2040, the government estimated. Other announcements include: The reset comes after years of ill-tempered relations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, which triggered one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history. Since Labour took office last year, governments worldwide have been forced to rethink their relationships on trade and defence, in response to US President Donald Trump's policies and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ministers believe there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union. Polling by YouGov suggests a majority of Britons now regret the Brexit vote and favour closer ties with the EU. But the Labour government's reset of EU relations comes at a time when Reform UK - a Eurosceptic party - is leading in the polls.

456203,"New buy now, pay later rules aim to protect shoppers",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg5le8p25o,"The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the ""wild west"" of unregulated borrowing. Under the legislation, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds. The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford. Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay. Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months. For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt. BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a ""crucial step"" towards better protection for shoppers. ""For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,"" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice. ""For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers."" Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous governmentunveiled plans in 2023. Under the new legislation, which is due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed. It says this means ""upfront"" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had ""transformed shopping for millions"", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a ""wild west"". ""These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,"" she added. Last week,a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had ""risen significantly"", climbing by two million in the past three years. It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products. Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated ""many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments"". A spokesman for Klarna, one of the biggest suppliers of BNPL services in the UK, said the company had supported regulation for the sector since 2020. ""It's good to see progress on regulation, and we look forward to working with the FCA on rules to protect consumers and encourage innovation,"" he said. Another major BNPL provider, Clearpay, said it would ""support the FCA to deliver fit-for-purpose regulation that ensures consumer protection, provides much-needed innovation in consumer credit, and supports the UK's thriving FinTech sector"".

18691,US debt downgrade drives up borrowing costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2j03w10gno,"Investors might have hoped the turmoil that hit financial markets last month was over. But another bout of volatility in US borrowing costs is a sign that worries continue to bubble. The interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed the 5% on Monday, before retreating slightly. That was the highest level since October 2023. It came after Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating on Friday, citing the rising debt over the past decade. Congress is meanwhile advancing a tax-and-spending bill that would add trillions to the US government's $36tn in debt. When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - sometimes called Treasuries - to investors on financial markets. Investors buy the bond, providing the government with cash, and are typically repaid, plus interest over a number of pre-agreed years. Just as with a regular loan, bonds perceived to be risky have higher interest rates, also called yields. Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks such as the Bank of England. Some hold on to the bonds until the term of the loan expires, while others sell them to other investors. Historically, the US government has been shielded from having to pay high interest rates, because Treasuries have been considered safe. That is because the US economy has been strong, with stable prices, and the US government was considered a reliable partner, unlikely to default. The yields on 30-year Treasuries hovered around 3% for much of decade following the 2008 financial crisis. When it crossed 5% in October 2023, it was the first time it had hit that threshold in 16 years. The yield on 30-year Treasuries climbed to 5.04% on Monday, up from 4.9% on Friday before the downgrade, before falling back under the 5% mark. So what are the new risks? Yields started rising in 2021, as the US was hit by soaring prices after the Covid-19 pandemic. Concerns reignited last month, after President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs globally, which analysts said would hurt the economy and drive up prices. At the same time, the US has been running up its debt, with little sign of slowdown in sight. On Friday,Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating, citing the growing debt and little progress toward resolving it. The move was not unexpected. Moody's was the last of the three rating agencies to take the step and had warned in 2023 that this might happen. But the situation it described was underscored when part of Congress voted on Sunday to advance a tax bill that would add at least $3tn to US debt over the next decade. The ""Moody's downgrade is, effectively, a political assessment, as much as it is an economic one"", wrote Macquarie Bank analyst Thierry Wizman. ""The political and institutional breakdown - in regard to the US's lack of capacity to 'course correct', is the true meaning of the downgrade, rather than the high debt load itself."" According to Moody's, interest payments in the US are on a path to consume 30% of the federal government's revenue by 2035, compared with 9% in 2021. If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself. Just as importantly, interest rates for the government typically influence interest rates charged on other kinds of loans, such as mortgages or credit cards. So higher interest rates for the government mean higher interest rates for households and businesses, too. Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time. First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs. Guernsey's Institute of Directors says renting leaves people with little money left over. UK Inflation has fallen but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions. The Federal Reserve said Trump's barrage of tariffs were generating too much uncertainty to predict its next moves. Guernsey's inflation rate remains higher than the UK and Jersey, according to the latest figures. Copyright 2025 BBC.

456185,Five unanswered questions in UK-EU deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz2jegmm3o,"The UK and the European Union have agreed a major new deal covering areas including trade, defence, fishing and energy. However, negotiations are still taking place on a number of key issues - leaving some important questions unanswered. The deal makes several references to a ""financial contribution"" from the UK to access certain benefits, notably an agreement to reduce checks on food exports to the EU. The prime minister's official spokesman said these were ""administrative costs"". He insisted they would not be ""big"" but refused to put a figure on how much the UK would pay. In other areas, terms are still being negotiated so the cost to the UK isn't known yet. For example, the two sides are working towards the UK rejoining the Erasmus+ exchange programme, which allows students to study or do work placements abroad. Rather than simply covering administrative costs, the UK would be expecting to get direct benefits in return and the government has said it will only take part ""on significantly improved financial terms"". The UK has agreed to work towards a ""youth experience scheme"" with the EU, which would allow young people from the bloc to apply for a visa to live and work in the UK and vice versa. The government has said any such deal would be ""capped and time-limited"" but it has not specified how many visas could be issued annually and how long they would be valid for. These details will be the subject of future negotiations. The UK already has similar schemes with 11 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with people able to stay for up to three years depending on which country they are from. Last year, just over 24,000 youth mobility visas were issued by the UK. Since Brexit, British travellers at EU airports have generally been forced to have their passport stamped at manned desks, rather than use automatic gates with facial recognition technology. Some airports already allow British passport-holders to use e-gates - but for those that don't the only alternative is often a lengthy queue. The deal states that there will be ""no legal barriers"" to Britons using e-gates when travelling to and from EU countriesafter the introduction of the European Union Entry-Exit System. The long-awaited digital border checks system is due to replace passport stamping for travellers from outside the EU in October. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said UK holidaymakers will want to get away ""without delay"" this summer and he wants them to be able to use e-gates ""as soon as possible"". But it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport holders can use e-gates at their airports. So whether this will be possible in more countries by the summer holidays is unclear. Since Brexit, British musicians have faced extra costs and red tape when touring Europe -and stars have long called for action to tackle this. Labour's general election manifesto last year pledged to ""help our touring artists"" as part of negotiations with the EU. But the deal agreed on Monday only recognises the ""value"" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts ""to support travel and cultural exchange"". The UK says it will explore ""how best to improve arrangements for touring across the European continent"". Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed this as ""an important first step"" but said the sector was seeking ""more concrete commitments"". Another promise in Labour's manifesto was to ""secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters"". This would mean professionals - such as doctors, lawyers, accountants and architects - who qualified in one country could practice in another with minimal extra bureaucracy. EU citizens already have the right to do this across the bloc. Such an agreement would make it easier for British companies to move staff between the UK and EU and undertake short-term work in Europe. However, there may be less incentive for the EU to reach a deal on this, given that the current situation makes it harder for UK firms to compete for business in Europe. Monday's deal only promises to set up ""dedicated dialogues"" on the recognition of professional qualifications. A full agreement in this area could take much longer to negotiate, if the EU will sign up to one at all. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. The two sides have struck a new post-Brexit deal but this so-called 'reset' of the relationship is just the beginning. Some goods will be allowed ""to flow freely again"" between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as the result of a new UK-EU deal, the government has said. The deal will enable staff to be recruited to work in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Copyright 2025 BBC.

881947,The world's most dangerous country for trade unionists,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j715l2d6no,"In July last year, Jesús Cometa was shot at as he was driving through the Cauca Valley in southwest Colombia. Gunmen on motorbikes pulled up alongside his car and sprayed it with bullets. Mr Cometa escaped uninjured but his bodyguard was hit. ""He still has a bullet lodged in his chest,"" he says. Mr Cometa is one of thousands of trade unionists who have been attacked in recent years in Colombia which, by some measurements, is the most dangerous place in the world for organised labour. The Cauca Valley is home to the country's sugar industry, and he is a local representative of Sintrainagro, Colombia's largest agricultural trade union. ""When you take on these roles in the union, you lose your social life,"" Mr Cometa says. ""You can't just go and hang out in a crowded bar, or on a street corner, because you never know when you might be targeted. ""Your family suffers too because they know that they're also targets."" This is a problem with a long history. In his ground-breaking novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Colombia's Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel García Márquez famously highlighted the massacre of workers on banana plantations in the country in the 1920s. The Labour Ministry says that since the early 1970s, well over 3,000 trade unionists have been murdered in Colombia. And even though the nation is more peaceful than it once was, the attacks continue. ""For many years now already, unfortunately, Colombia is the deadliest country in the world for trade unionists and for trade union work,"" says Luc Triangle, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a global umbrella organization based in Brussels. Every year the ITUC publishes a survey of the atrocities carried out against trade unionists around the world. Its most recent edition covers the year to the end of March 2024. It found that in those 12 months, 22 trade unionists were killed for their activism around the world. Eleven of themwere murdered in Colombia. ""Generally, these are targeted murders,"" Mr Triangle says. ""They know what they are doing. They know who they want to murder. ""It's not targeting the big bosses of the trade unions or the leaders. They are targeting in small villages people that are doing active trade union work. ""Between 2020 and 2023, we recorded 45 murders in Colombia. In 2022, 29 murders. It's less violent than it once was, but it's still very violent, certainly if you compare it with other countries."" Why is this happening? Fabio Arias, the head of Colombia's largest trade union federation, the CUT, says it is all part of Colombia's long and complex civil conflict, which pitted left-wing rebel groups against right-wing paramilitaries, drug traffickers and the Colombian state, and which still rumbles on in some parts of the country. ""The trade union movement has always been linked to the parties of the left and unfortunately the many right-wing governments we've had in Colombia have always claimed that anyone who is a leftist is a guerrilla, a terrorist,"" Mr Arias says. ""And once you've established that, then people feel justified in attacking them."" He says the attacks on workers are also linked to Colombia's illegal economies, notably the cocaine trade and illegal mining. ""If you look at where these attacks are happening, it's in the departments of Cauca, Nariño, Putumayo, Arauca, Norte de Santander and Caquetá, because that's where the biggest coca plantations are, and where the illegal mining is."" It is not clear who is carrying out these killings and who is ordering them. Some trade unionists blame the private sector, saying businesses, desperate to stifle any attempt by workers to organize, are paying armed groups to carry out these atrocities. They point to the fact that threats and attacks tend to spike at times when businesses and unions are in wage negotiations. But as many of the attacks go unpunished, it is difficult to know who exactly is to blame. ""In the Cauca Valley there are so many different armed groups you never really know who's behind the attacks, who's carrying them out, who's ordering them,"" says Zenón Escobar, another sugar cane worker and local representative of Sintrainagro. The threats in the Cauca Valley are not limited to the sugar industry. ""In 2007, I was in a van, and guys drew up next to us on a motorbike and asked for me, and then opened fire,"" recalls Jimmy Núñez, the leader of a union that represents street traders in the regional capital Cali. ""My colleague who was sitting next to me was killed, and my wife was injured. In 2010 they attacked me again, on the road between Cauca and Cali. ""They opened fire on my car. In 2012 we were attacked in a shopping centre in Cali and one of us was killed. And in 2013 my family had to leave Cauca due to threats. ""In this country social leaders and trade union leaders are killed every day."" The government says it is doing what it can to protect trade unionists. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, heads a left-wing administration that is broadly sympathetic to the country's workers. In 2023, it took a step towards redressing the past by formally recognizing the trade union movement – collectively, and for the first time – as a victim of Colombia's conflict. That gives victims a greater chance of having their cases investigated. ""We consider this as an important step to recognize the violence against trade unionists in Colombia, which was not the case before,"" says Luc Triangle of the ITUC. He also says foreign companies with operations in Colombia must do more. ""If I were the CEO of a multinational, I would question my activities in Colombia,"" he says. ""There is a huge responsibility for multinational companies. They cannot have a nice code of conduct, and at the same time remain silent when trade unionists are killed. ""That's not acceptable. Global companies and foreign investors in Colombia must step up."" Additional reporting by Immie Rhodes. The previous government had said autonomous vehicles were ""set to be on the road"" by 2026.

636510,"Five House Republicans stall Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqelqpvpeqo,"A budget bill, long touted by Donald Trump as the ""big, beautiful bill"" hit a roadblock on Friday when lawmakers from the president's own party voted against it in congress. Five Republicans joined all Democrats in delivering a stunning setback to President Trump's domestic agenda, demanding deeper budget cuts. Trump, who has muscled through close votes several times this year, urged lawmakers to unite behind the legislation. ""We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!,"" he posted on Truth Social. The bill's chances of success are not hopeless, but its failure gives the Trump administration its first legislative bruise of the year. Support for the bill among Republicans varies. Some hard-liners want to see the budget cuts go further, while other Republicans have expressed concern about cuts to programmes like Medicaid, which their constituents are dependent on. The five Republicans who voted against the measure in the procedural vote said they would continue to withhold support unless Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to further cut Medicaid, a healthcare programme for lower-income Americans. They also want Johnson to include a full repeal of green energy tax cuts, implemented by Democrats, in the bill. ""This bill falls profoundly short,"" said Texas Republican Chip Roy, who voted against the measure.  ""It does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits."" The proposed legislation would extend tax cuts implemented during Trump's first administration. While Trump touts the bill's inclusion of a no tax on tips policy, some critics argue the bill benefits wealthy Americans. Democrats, who overwhelmingly oppose the bill, have been urging the reconsideration of Medicaid cuts and spending cuts to the Affordable care Act which offers millions of Americans subsidised health insurance. ""No other previous bill, no other previous law, no other previous event caused so many millions of Americans to lose their healthcare. Not even the Great Depression,"" Pennsylvania Democrat Brendan Boyle said. If passed, the tax cuts would cost $3.72 trillion (£2.8t) over ten years, according to congress's bipartisan Joint Tax Committee.

209591,US proposes dropping Boeing criminal charge,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0lpqpyro,"US prosecutors may drop a criminal charge against the aerospace giant Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. In an online meeting with relatives of those who died in the two accidents, officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan. ""While DOJ claims no final decision has been made, their scripted presentation made it clear that the outcome has already been decided,"" said Erin Applebaum, a partner at Kreindler and Kreindler, which represents 34 families of those killed in the Ethiopian crash. ""Boeing has never stood trial for the 346 lives lost due to its admitted crimes. Now, DOJ is prepared to let the company walk away, again, with no more than a financial penalty,"" she added.  Boeing currently faces a criminal fraud conspiracy charge, brought in the aftermath of two major 737 Max accidents in late 2018 off Indonesia and in Ethiopia in early 2019. The crashes, which killed 346 people, were blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software, which the pilots were not aware had been fitted to the aircraft. The Department of Justice subsequently accused Boeing of deliberately concealing vital information about the system from regulators, charging the firm with fraud. The firm admitted to the allegations but initially avoided prosecution by paying $2.5bn in fines and compensation and pledging to improve safety standards and compliance programmes. The case was reopened last year, after an incident in which an unused door fell off a 737 Max early in flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. The DOJ  accused Boeing of having breached the terms of the original settlement. Last year, during the Biden administration, a new deal was reached with prosecutors under which Boeing would plead guilty to the fraud charge, pay a further fine of $243m and agree to a court-appointed monitor overseeing its operations for a set period. But the agreement was rejected in December by a US district court judge overseeing the case, due in part to concerns over how the monitor would be selected. The ruling meant the case would extend into the Trump administration, which has promised to take a lighter regulatory approach. It is understood that Boeing has since sought to withdraw its guilty plea. Boeing declined to comment on Friday. The Department of Justice did not respond. A non-prosecution agreement would not involve admitting to criminal charges. That would spare Boeing from a criminal record, a black mark that would complicate its dealings as a contractor for the government. The case is currently due to go to trial on 23 June. The commitment from the state-owned airline comes as Boeing pushes to rebuild its business. Boeing's boss says it's looking to sell 50 more planes China has on order to other countries. The F-47 fighter jet contract is a boost for Boeing, which has faced slumps in both military and civilian sales. John Barnett's family say he was subjected to harassment and humiliation after he raised safety concerns. US president says he is looking for alternatives because Boeing is taking too long to build new planes Copyright 2025 BBC.

It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than120 million people worldwidein its first month. It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimedin a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a ""oner"", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming. Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry. At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again. You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator – there's a minuscule wobble – but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless. It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects. This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage. The result is ""phenomenal"", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer. He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. ""As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take."" Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds. In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. ""It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,"" he recalls. Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes – but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence. Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated. He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. ""That's a complete game-changer,"" he says. Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades. Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some haveexpressed scepticismabout this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen tells the BBC emphatically, ""There are no edits or cuts."" While Mr Brandth Grøvlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional – the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones. ""It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,"" says Mr Brandth Grøvlen, ""You're taken on a journey."" He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Grøvlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve ""muscle memory"" of the process. ""When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle – that way it shakes a little bit less,"" he explains. The Ronin 4D is DJI's ""first dedicated cinema camera"", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm. He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal. There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming – increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok. Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most ""ideal"" solution, he acknowledges. Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models. Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests. The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. ""Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,"" he says. ""It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories."" There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics. Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices. But fascination over ""oners"" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: ""Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take – I want to watch these things because they're good.""

785616,Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK/EU summit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxykl7kypno,"The right of young people to move freely between the UK and EU has emerged as a key negotiating point - along with fishing rights - ahead of a summit in London which the prime minister hopes will ""reset"" relations between the two sides. Before Brexit, people were allowed to come and go under ""freedom of movement"" rules. The EU would like a new ""youth mobility scheme"" but there are concerns about what impact this might have on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another potential sticking point with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, but UK fishing groups calling for changes to it. BBC Verify has been examining both issues and why they are important. Since Brexit, UK and EU citizens no longer have an automatic right to live, work, or study in each other's countries. To come to the UK for an extended period, EU nationals usually need specific visas - many of which require a sponsor. Following these new rules, there has been a significant drop in the number of EU students coming to the UK. The UK does have an existingYouth Mobility Scheme (YMS)which allows young adults to live, work and study in the UK for up to two years. People from specific countries can applybut not from EU ones. They have to pay an application fee, the health surcharge, and have at least £2,530 in savings. Unlike most other visa schemes, the YMS does not require sponsorship. Last year, just over 24,000 YMS visas were issued - Australians were the largest single group, followed by New Zealanders and Canadians. Just over a year ago, theEU proposed a ""youth mobility scheme"" for EU and UK citizens (aged 18 to 30), allowing stays of up to four years. The idea was rejected by the-then Conservative government. It it is politically sensitive, given Sir Keir Starmer's pledge to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned against ""backsliding on freedom of movement"". Documents circulated between EU statessuggested any deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. ""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang, all come at once,"" she said. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper isreportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one yearso that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap. Another consideration, Ms Sumption points out, is how many people would go home when their temporary visa comes to an end. ""Even on temporary visas, people do stay. They get a job offer and end up getting a skilled visa through their employer"", she says. The Oxford Migration Observatory says about 10% of people who arrived on temporary worker visas in 2014 from Australia, Canada and New Zealand remained in the UK at the end of 2023. Fishing is another sensitive subject. The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights - who gets to fish where - expires at the end of June 2026. Several EU countries, including France, areasking the UK for concessions, in return for the things the UK wants from the summit. They are pushing for along-term extension of the current arrangements, agreed in 2020. Fishing only accounts foran estimated 0.04% of UK GDPbut it was a big issue in the Brexit campaign and promises were made that the UK would become an ""independent coastal state"". Under the Brexit deal in 2020 however, EU boats were given continued access to UK waters. In 2023,UK vessels landed 719,000 tonnes of fish- an increase of 14% compared to 2019. However, this growth has been driven by Scottish catches, while English fishing boats have seen a fall in their landings. This is linked to the way in which fish quotas were divided up after Brexit, benefitting some areas. At the same time, it has become harder for the UK to export fish to the EU due to post-Brexit paperwork and checks. In 2023, the UK exported 235,606 tonnes of fish to the EU. That's down 29% compared to the 2019 figure of 333,403 tonnes. Chris Ranford, Chief Executive of the Cornish Fish Producers' Organisation (CFPO), represents 175 member vessels and says nothing much has changed, sinceBBC Verify last spoke to him in 2022. He says French vessels are still fishing off the Cornish coast: ""Very modern, very high-powered French fishing vessels that have much greater catching capacity than the UK or Cornish boats come up to the six-mile line. We don't have space to fish."" For him, the number one priority for any future fishing deal is to stop EU vessels entering the stretch of coastal water that lies between six and 12 nautical miles offshore. France has reportedly called for continued access to UK waters for its fishing boats, in exchange for a defence deal the UK is pushing for. We asked the Maritime Fisheries Committee for Northern France for comment. Another area of improvement Mr Ranford is calling for is easier access to EU markets. ""Our small to medium-sized businesses can't afford to do the extra paperwork to get the fish to the EU market,"" he said. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, says: ""The market access to the EU has become more bureaucratic."" She says she is disappointed with the five-year fishing deal the UK signed up to. ""Our position approaching the EU reset… is that the access to each other's waters would be on the basis of annual discussions"". ""By having that lever around access, the UK could secure a much fairer share of the resources in our own waters."" There are strong opinions on both sides on fishing and youth mobility. If the UK is to get what it wants from the summit, including easing the trade in agricultural goods between the UK and the EU, there will have to be some give and take in the coming days. Correction 19 May: An earlier version of this article misstated fishing's contribution to UK GDP. The correct figure is 0.04%. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

1106076,Wegovy firm unexpectedly forces boss to step down,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80k581dyx4o,"Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Wegovy and Ozempic, is abruptly ousting its chief executive over concerns the firm is losing ground in the popular weight-loss drug market. The firm's market value has dropped by roughly half over the last year, as alternatives from competitors such as Eli Lilly gain traction. Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen has led the company since 2017, overseeing its rise to become the most valuable company in Europe after the launch of its flagship anti-obesity drugs. He will stay in the role until a successor is appointed. The company said its controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, had started talks about replacing Mr Jørgensen in recent weeks as a result of ""market challenges"" and the slide in its share price. ""Considering the recent market challenges, the share price decline, and the wish from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Novo Nordisk Board and Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen have jointly concluded that initiating a chief executive succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,"" the company said in a statement. As part of the changes, the firm said that its former chief executive, Lars Rebien Sørensen, who now leads the Novo Nordisk Foundation, will also take on a greater role on the firm's board. Mr Jørgensen started at the company in 1991. In an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2, he said that he had not seen the decision coming, according to Reuters. The move also caught many analysts off-guard. On a conference call with board chair Helge Lund, they pressed him on whether there were other factors behind the decision and whether it indicated a lack of confidence in the firm's strategy. ""Share price decline is not exactly something he can control so I was wondering if you can give some more detail on what exactly has driven this change right now,"" said Danske Bank analyst Carsten Lonborg Madsen, noting that the company had had only a handfulleaders since its start. ""This is something that has been going on since mid 2024,"" he said, referring to the slide in share price value. ""It just feels like there's something that has gone pretty wrong here."" ""I'm sorry to belabour the point but I have to say that I'm confused by the discussion,"" Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim Securities said later. ""If I were the next potential chief executive I would be very nervous to take the role."" Mr Lund acknowledged that the decision might look abrupt, noting that up until now it had been anticipating a slower succession timeline. He said the firm would make an announcement of a new leader ""in due course"" and it did not signal a change in the its strategy or plans. ""There is nothing more behind this,"" he said. Shares in the firm fell further after the announcement. Since 2021, Novo Nordisk has more than doubled its sales. But growth has been slowing. Last year, sales rose 25% to more than 290bn Danish kroner (£33bn), while profits were up roughly 20%. The company earlier this month predicted sales growth between 13% and 21%, with growth in operating profit between 16% to 24%.

146770,Will this woman be the first Briton to walk on the Moon?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyv3z710do,"Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit. It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head. The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet – assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The pool – which is 12m deep (40ft) – contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a ""spacewalk"" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth. ""It's a big day,"" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. ""It's very physically intense – and it's very psychologically intense."" But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water. Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach. ""At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,"" Rosemary says. ""You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories."" So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people. ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015. Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar. She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views. ""It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside – to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia."" Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet. ""The lower part is where you put your solid waste,"" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. ""And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste."" Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to. ""There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system."" Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains. Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity. She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks. Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth. It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit. ""You do a lot of mental preparation – you really think through every single movement,"" Rosemary explains. ""You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again."" Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks. Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts. ""When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,"" he says. ""It is baby steps, but they are moving forward – and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool."" Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V – the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon. ""It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,"" she says. After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test – but then she's thrown a curve ball. In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence. On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition – and tow him back to the airlock. After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is – but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock. ""Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,"" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. ""We're really happy with where she's at – she's doing awesome."" The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling. ""It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,"" she tells us, ""But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day."" Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space. ""It's amazing,"" Rosemary says, ""If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top."" The group was founded by Dr George Capone who said boxing made her feel stronger. A new book How to Kill a Witch brings a dark period of history back to grisly life – and an official tartan is being released to memorialise some of those who were tortured and killed. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, ""space archaeologists"" are scrambling to save what's left. Organisers say a failure to speak out or provide clarity after the Supreme Court gender ruling has led to ""mass confusion"".

137298,"Why scientists are counting tiny marine creatures, from Space",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g41845jdo,"Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space. The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures. ""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica. The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space. Krill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them. They are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill,  krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants. However, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable. Mr Downie said: ""We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas. ""[This project could] give us a new tool to help monitor and safeguard this vital species.""

671367,Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gm3jwljo,"The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests. More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012. That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019. The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers. Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly. The switch back towetter conditions over the past couple of weekshas largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels. The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km). More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year. Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly. ""We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,"" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office. ""This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start."" A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires. ""The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,"" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. ""Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable."" The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record. The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year. InGalloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total. A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km. Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April. These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated. Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health. Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover. Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again. ""My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,"" said Prof Rein, when ""there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic"". ""You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses."" The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season. But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year. Astudy led by the Met Officefound that the extreme ""fire weather"" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change. Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk. ""One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,"" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh. ""We need to be prepared for this to become more common.""

Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport. The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day – but there was no such day during my two-week stay. Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist. ""I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,"" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996. ""Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here."" During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region – but had hardly any luck there either. Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly. Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change. June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low. Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best. But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December. Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business. ""In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,"" she added An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a ""major let-down"". ""It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,"" said John Carrol. Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble. ""Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,"" he told the BBC. On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before. ""We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,"" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand. However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again. The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities. But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen. ""The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,"" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency. South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world. Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures. Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round. This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing. ""Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,"" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC. In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region. This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards. ""We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,"" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri. ""And there is nothing we can do about the haze."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.Sign up here.

601567,Mosquito-borne killer disease threatens blackbirds,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3x6v05ly6o,"A mosquito-borne disease freshly arrived in Britain has spread large distances, with scientists racing to understand the risks to wild birds. Infected insects can spread the deadly Usutu virus to blackbirds, raising fears for the famous songsters. New data shows Usutu has spread across much of southern England in five years, and has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations. Scientists are monitoring its spread amid warnings that mosquitoes and the diseases they carry may expand their range under climate change. ""We've seen that the virus has spread further than we thought it might do, and it's persisted,"" Dr Arran Folly of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) told the BBC.  Scientists at the APHA in Weybridge, Surrey, have been tracking mosquito-borne diseases in wild birds for decades, amidwarningsthat climate change is turning Europe into a potential breeding ground for the insects. Longer summers, hotter temperatures and heavy rainfall are creating conditions for the nuisance insects to move into areas that were previously inhospitable to them. Until 2020, all results came back clear.  Then, after the summer heatwave of that year, Usutu was detected in several blackbirds in Greater London. ""Blackbirds specifically are quite susceptible to the virus and since 2020 we've found a decline in blackbirds of approximately 40% in Greater London,"" said Dr Folly. ""It gives an indication that in the future we might get other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes emerging in the UK."" Diseases such as Usutu are a growing threat to wild birds, amid a host of other pressures, including habitat loss, climate change and pesticide use.  The latest data shows that Usutu has spread further than the scientists expected. It has now been detected in wild birds across much of southern England, at least as far west as Dorset and as far north as Cambridgeshire. How big a risk Usutu poses to wild birds is uncertain. The virus has been linked to mass die-offs of blackbirds elsewhere in Europe, though that doesn't seem to be the case in Britain. And the blackbird remains one of the commonest garden birds with numbers holding steady in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas, and in the north.  To untangle the puzzle – and gather more data on blackbird numbers – the scientists have joined forces with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). They are calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens over the summer  months to find out more about the comings and goings of the birds. Around now blackbirds are breeding and raising their young, frequently seen hopping along the ground and singing from the branches of trees on summer evenings. Lucy Love, a garden birdwatch ambassador for the BTO, knows the blackbirds in her gardens by sight and has grown fond of them. ""They're beautiful birds – intelligent, friendly and they have the most beautiful song with a lovely melodic tone to it,"" she explained.

585039,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

758374,Designer creates final garden for Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20qpq0dgd5o,"A multi-award winning garden designer created his tenth and final garden for the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Tom Hoblyn, who lives in Bardwell, Suffolk, designed a sensory garden for the end-of-life charity,Hospice UKcalledGarden of Compassion. ""I jumped at the chance at doing this,"" said Hoblyn, who has also designed gardens for children's hospicesHaven House, in Woodford Green, east London andThe Nook, near Norwich. ""There's a desperate shortage of gardens in hospices; they play a vital role in creating a positive atmosphere for end-of-life care."" Hoblyn said it was important to create a design for the show that ""grounds people in nature, and to activate all the senses"". ""Smell, sight, sound, touch is particularly important in a hospice garden,"" he added. The garden was inspired by Mediterranean themes, which allowed him to use very bright colours as well as heavily scented flowers, such as the Spanish broom, Spartium junceum. ""The fact you're using a lot of Mediterranean plants means you attract a lot of insects, so you get a lot of noise too,"" he said. While many gardeners may have been mourning the lack of rain this spring, Hoblyn's dry and hot garden has not. ""This is my 10th garden for Chelsea, and it's never been without rain before, so this is an absolute blessing, this is great,"" he said. Explaining why this was his final Chelsea garden, he said he had spent 18 months on the Garden of Compassion. ""It's a lot, and I do have real work I should be doing,"" he said. ""It's also time, we need more young people in horticulture, we need to make way [for them]."" He added he would now like to devote some time to mentoring young people for Chelsea. The designer has been involved with pieces at the London horticultural show for the past 25 years, winning many accolades. ""We've done well, but it's not just me - I just surround myself with the best people,"" he said. Looking back, he said his highlights included winning the People's Choice award at Chelsea in 2012, again for a Mediterranean garden. ""To get People's Choice is so rewarding, it's not just based on judges, but the people's views,"" he said. Hoblyn's garden was funded byProject Giving Back.

233274,Water voles are almost extinct - could glitter save them?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx08exwp97o,"Endangered water voles in Wales are being fed edible glitter in a bid to save them from extinction. Once commonly found across south Wales, water voles are now effectively extinct in all but a few locations, according to the Wildlife Trust. With their future hanging in the balance, conservationists have been looking for new ways to track the naturally shy individuals in the wild - which is where the glitter comes in. The Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) hopes that by offering the animals something sparkly to eat, the sparkle should come out the other end - providing some much-needed answers. Rob Parry, chief executive of INCC, said his team had consulted with vets to ensure the edible and biodegradable glitter - the type used to decorate cakes - would not be harmful to the semi-aquatic creatures. ""It's something that we've done in nature conservation before for other species, for badgers in particular where we use pellets to put in with peanuts, which badgers love,"" said Mr Parry. ""So we've taken that idea and scaled it down to water vole size, which means using glitter."" The hope is that if the water voles are willing to consume the glitter then it will come out in their poo, allowing the small mammals - which are often mistaken for brown rats - to be tracked by conservationists. Different colours of glitter could be used to allow conservationists to track different families of water voles and how far they range. It might sound like a fun idea, but Mr Parry and his team could not be more serious. If they can track where water voles are located in the wild, they can make adjustments to the environment - like removing invasive conifers from wetland habitats or fencing off certain riverbanks to stop sheep grazing. Measures like this could help the species to disperse through the landscape undisturbed and potentially be a life-saving intervention. ""We'll be able to see the types of territory, the size and where they go in,"" said Mr Parry. ""Are they just using the linear features, the ditches, or are they spreading out into the bog and the molinia grassland habitat? ""That will be really crucial for when it comes to planning for our upland habitats."" The team is first testing out their theory on some captive-bred water voles which are part of a wider Natural Resources Wales (NRW)  project to reintroduce colonies into the wild. The glitter is spread onto chunks of apple, not part of their normal diet in the wild, but a food the animals love and do well on in captivity, according to Richard Davies from NRW. ""They get everything they need from apples, carrots, and some dried rabbit food as well,"" he said. He has successfully bred hundreds of water voles which have been reintroduced into the wild, though he said their release was no guarantee of survival. ""Most predators in the UK would quite happily take a water vole. They need to be able to cope with this heavy predation and replace themselves a lot,"" he said. With a BBC News camera present, the glittery purple apple was placed on top of the straw bedding which covered the water voles' pen. After 20 minutes, the food remained untouched, but an hour later most of it had disappeared. The success of the project, however, does not just depend on the appetite of the water voles, but how well the glitter can retain its shine from end to end. Mr Parry said without interventions like this, the future for water voles was uncertain. ""It's been a perfect storm of bad things that's happened to water voles in the last few decades,"" he said. ""We have drained an awful lot of their wetland habitat, forced them into linear ditches where we find them now, and then the biggest problem is the American mink, an invasive species that was let out and released from pens and they just turned out to be the perfect water vole predators. The water voles don't stand a chance, really."" But now, at least, he is more hopeful. The water voles, known for being nervous about any changes to to their environment, had not rejected the glitter. So, did the experiment work? Just 24 hours later, a tiny glittery poo was spotted.

873338,Titanic scan reveals ground-breaking details of ship's final hours,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o,"A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours. The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on. And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise. ""Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,"" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst. The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection. The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots. More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the ""digital twin"",which was revealedexclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023. Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic. The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage. But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half. The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship. ""It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,"" said Parks Stephenson. ""And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here."" The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision. Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two. Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves. The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water. Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system. This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on. All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson. ""They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,"" he told the BBC. ""They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern."" A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking. It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg. ""We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,"" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research. The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull. Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments. ""The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,"" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle. ""But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks."" Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment. The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible. Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor. The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica. ""She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,"" said Parks Stephenson. ""Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.""

819981,Nasa needs saving from itself – but is this billionaire right for that job?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93797z2dpo,"Listen to Pallab read this article Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity. He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 – a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (£160m) for – and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date – most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy. ""We want it to be 600,000,"" he told reporters. Later, he added: ""I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species… I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft."" Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (£1.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space. Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule andperforming the first commercial spacewalk. During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock. The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic – it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology. And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still – being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa. The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do – especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX ownerElon Musk to a government roleto cut $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) off the Federal budget. The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now. In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs. Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values. And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space. They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel. On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. ""This second space age has only just begun,"" he wrote. ""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy – one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space… At Nasa, we will… usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation."" Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, butTrump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan. But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets. That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank. ""You have a government looking to slash,"" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. ""If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget… ""This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table."" One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch. By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch – and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (£8m) as he develops his system. Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (£54.5m). Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further. Starshipand New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But ""that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs"", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University. ""SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,"" he continues. ""They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs. ""A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way. ""There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future."" The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: ""Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs. ""Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (£20bn) for key activities"". Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration – some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (£800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 – but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of ""the telescope that ate astronomy"". (Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.) It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s. Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US. But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. ""Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue."" The current model is to give so-called ""cost-plus"" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit. The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that tookApollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns. Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things. ""We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things."" Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget. Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo. The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job. SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years – only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronautsButch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station. The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule. ""Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,"" says Prof Logsdon. ""So, shaking up the system is very positive."" Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS ""outrageously expensive"" and said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"". But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (£20bn) annual budget. ""Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,"" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress. Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt. ""The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,"" argues Prof Logsdon. ""There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House."" Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy – Musk – seated nearby. Others fear cuts inNasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme. There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (£16bn) in contracts from government since 2008. But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players. And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March. But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon. ""Isaacman is his own man,"" he adds. ""He is not a disciple of Elon Musk."" Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue – Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion. But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception. ""Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,"" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. ""That is frustrating for all of us."" Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: ""Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service. ""The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things – and there are so many hard things"".

861447,Blow to clean energy drive as major windfarm ditched,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce848g8l8vro#comments,"In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire. The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW – enough to power more than a million homes. Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price. The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised ""the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe."" But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project. The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs. Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through. However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target – one of the Labour government's five central ""missions"". Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass – organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 – so in just five years' time. In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy. It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment. Many local communities are pushing back at the prospect of major new energy infrastructure near their homes. Some industry experts - as well as the Conservative and Reform parties – say the 2030 target is not achievable. Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible. ""In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,"" he has warned. Chris Stark, the head of the government's Clean Power 2030 mission, has conceded the target will be – as he put it - ""bloody hard"", but that with a ""Herculean effort"" itcan be met. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, accepts the plan it is ambitious and controversial but is adamant that it is essential to: ""cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security."" The government has said it plans to work with Orsted to get Hornsea 4 ""back on track"" and said it believed the clean power mission was still achievable. ""We have a strong pipeline of projects to deliver clean power by 2030 and our mission-led approach ensures we can steer our way through global pressures and individual commercial decisions to reach our targets,"" a spokesperson said.

179274,Mystery of medieval cemetery near airport runway deepens,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241e3jr7qlo,"A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying. The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century,was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts. Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury. Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care. ""Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,"" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project. About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated. So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female. ""I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,"" said Dr Seaman. ""It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery."" The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features. ""The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,"" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University. ""It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery."" Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were. Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead. ""Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,"" said Dr Seaman. ""It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels."" The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west. The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal. They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her. Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.  Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis. The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too. Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related. The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth. Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death. ""They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,"" said Dr Faillace. ""And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population. ""But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries."" The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery. Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up. ""We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,"" he said. ""We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.""

199193,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vd1zjlr5lo,"The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals. Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds. These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA. This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago. Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System. ""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?"" The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted. A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023. About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove. ""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks. About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.  The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds. These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA  - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too. Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now. ""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell. This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth. ""The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,"" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum. The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible. But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too. ""Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,"" said Dr King. ""And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?"" It's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer. They have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore. A group of researchers have come to Pipestone Creek in Canada to figure out why thousands of dinosaurs are buried here.

1016560,Astronauts Butch and Suni begin journey home after nine months in space,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k0d55q24o,"After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finallyon their way home. Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems. The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) . Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough. It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy. The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C. As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity. Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean. Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it. ""They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,"" she told BBC News. The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return – and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end. The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space. They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station. And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended. ""We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,"" he said. Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission. ""I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,"" she said. ""I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow."" The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner. But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs. Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission. ""It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,"" he told BBC News. ""And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars…. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'."" Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets. Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space. ""I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,"" he told the BBC. ""It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss."" The BBC meets astronaut Rosemary Coogan who is training at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas.

A dig which is taking place at Les Huguettes on Longis Common is exploring more of a second roundhouse structure that was found on the site in 2024. Further remains of Iron Age pots and ammunition from the German Occupation in World War Two have been found by volunteers from group Dig Alderney who are on site until 23 May. The site was discovered accidentally in the late 1960s when the island's golf course was being created. Dr Phil de Jersey, of Dig Alderney, said the site was ""very important"". ""The discovery of another round-house in 2024 suggests that the settlement extended further up the slope, and we hope to find more of it this year to add to the results obtained from the original excavations, more than half a century ago,"" he said. An end of excavation lecture supported by the Alderney Society will be held at the Island Hall on 21 May said Dig Alderney. The group is posting updates on itsFacebook page.

601949,Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6denxzweeo,"Listen to Justin read this article Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers — a routine they have gone through many a time before. It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads – for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations. They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London. However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously. In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, ""hanging up the hi-viz"" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience. The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate. Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a ""joyful celebration"". ""We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,"" she says. The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost £20m. But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that? JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable – they had to wait around to get arrested. For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity. The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the ""eco-loons"", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call. The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing ""serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity"" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time. The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including ""locking on"" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure. At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a ""lawful excuse"" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the ""beliefs and motivation"" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it. ""We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,"" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon. David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously ""favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people."" The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy. Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have ""had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe"". In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability – they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more. Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables. I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore. ""It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,"" the spokesperson told me. ""Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground."" I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works. This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall. The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions. He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people. ""There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,"" he says. Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance – implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO – against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies. The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they ""arrest"" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for. The group claims to have ""arrested"" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, ""disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,"" she says. These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers. Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed. But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions. ""It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,"" he tells me. ""Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority."" Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public. Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way. But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group. According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy. There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO. Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning. ""Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,"" says Read, ""but that's not the same thing as getting real change."" They generated a lot of headlines: ""[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause."" John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change. But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. ""I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,"" he says. His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns. XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. ""If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,"" he says. He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities. ""The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,"" explains Read. Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes ""empowering"" voters should be the focus. ""We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk […] truth to power."" But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. ""If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest […] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest."" He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO. Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage ""they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences."" But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. ""We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,"" says Packham. It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. ""The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,"" she says. ""Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue."" However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.

424232,Communities to consider major solar farm proposal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k9dkwzmlo,"Plans for a large new solar farm have gone out to consultation among several communities. A 675-acre (273-hectare) plot of land around Mendlesham, near Stowmarket, has been earmarked forthe major White Elm project. Conservative-controlled Suffolk County Council said it would object to the proposal if high quality farmland was affected. But Spanish firm Elmya RPC UK Grange Road Ltd, which is expected to submit plans in 2026, said it would power more than 40,000 homes a year. Labour's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will have the final say on the plans. A consultation began on Monday and is due to run until 30 June. The White Elm site, which also surrounds Wickham Skeith and Thwaite, sits five miles (8km) south of anotherproposed solar farm in Yaxley. ""I'm sure the reaction of many Suffolk residents will be 'here we go again',"" said Conservative councillor Richard Rout. He warned the application would move ""very quickly"" and urged residents to voice their concerns. ""Do object and give clear reasons why, but also make constructive suggestions to amend and improve the plans in case it goes ahead,"" Rout added. In a statement, the county council said solar farms ""should not remove Suffolk's best quality farmland"" from food production. Concerns have also been raised about where a substation would be built for the development, which is expected to have a 40-year lifespan. A spokesman for Elmya RPC UK Grange Road Ltd' said it was in the early stages of shaping the solar farm. He said a storage system was being created to retain any excess energy for ""when the sun isn't shining"". ""If approved, White Elm Solar Farm would generate enough clean electricity to power over 40,000 typical family homes every year during its 40-year operational lifespan,"" he added.

125829,Moon dust 'rarer than gold' arrives in UK from China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3krykxypo,"The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China. The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as ""more precious than gold dust"". ""Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,"" he says. After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago. China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons Rümker. A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia. It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race. Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries. The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe. ""It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,"" he said. He returned to the UK with the precious cargo in the safest place he could think of - his hand luggage. At his lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, we step onto sticky mats to clean our shoes and put on plastic gloves, gowns, hair nets and hoods. The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination. If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specks, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do.  We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace. Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom. That is the Moon dust. It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey. And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total. ""Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,"" he adds. In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened. She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface. ""I'm extremely excited,"" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade. ""But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,"" she adds. After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs. In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires. Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases. This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples. James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust. He shows us a test run of what he will do. ""I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,"" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen. ""It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,"" he says. The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples. But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission.

1017725,Blow to clean energy drive as major windfarm ditched,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce848g8l8vro,"In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire. The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW – enough to power more than a million homes. Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price. The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised ""the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe."" But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project. The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs. Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through. However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target – one of the Labour government's five central ""missions"". Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass – organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 – so in just five years' time. In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy. It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment. Many local communities are pushing back at the prospect of major new energy infrastructure near their homes. Some industry experts - as well as the Conservative and Reform parties – say the 2030 target is not achievable. Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, has long argued building out this infrastructure in the timescale would be near impossible. ""In failing to meet a very short-term target, it is going to maximise the costs of trying,"" he has warned. Chris Stark, the head of the government's Clean Power 2030 mission, has conceded the target will be – as he put it - ""bloody hard"", but that with a ""Herculean effort"" itcan be met. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, accepts the plan it is ambitious and controversial but is adamant that it is essential to: ""cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security."" The government has said it plans to work with Orsted to get Hornsea 4 ""back on track"" and said it believed the clean power mission was still achievable. ""We have a strong pipeline of projects to deliver clean power by 2030 and our mission-led approach ensures we can steer our way through global pressures and individual commercial decisions to reach our targets,"" a spokesperson said.

238223,New plan for bins and recycling to be considered,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg1lxmv2eo,"Weekly household food waste collections and changes to bins and recycling are being considered by Lancaster City Council. All councils are being told to follow a government ""simpler recycling"" scheme which aims to create consistent waste collection and recycling arrangements to reduce the use of landfill tips and to recycle more materials like paper, tins, glass and plastics. Also food waste can be used in some processes to generate heat energy or for fertilisers for farms and gardens. The council's cabinet will meet to decide the best way for the collections to be introduced in the district, possibly switching from the current recycling boxes to new wheelie bins. Larger bins would make it easier for households to store recyclables like glass, plastic, tins, cardboard and paper and reduce mess on the streets. If the proposals get the green light, recycling collections would move to every three weeks instead of every two, because there will be more space in each bin. The same three-week cycle is also being proposed for non-recyclable waste, with the expectation that people throw away less once they start recycling food waste weekly. Paul Hart, cabinet member for environmental services, said: ""I know these are big changes, but other councils that have already made the switch are seeing less waste and more being recycled. ""That's what we're aiming for too."" The city council has received around £1.46m from the government to support food waste collections. This will be used to buy new vehicles and food waste caddies for households, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid.

335377,Exceptionally low river levels raise fears over water supplies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkn7rjv7zo#comments,"Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses. The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century. Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales. The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions. The next 2-3 weeks will be ""crucial"" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group. That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way. The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt. Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year. ""We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,"" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk. He had to start irrigating his fields in March. ""We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,"" he said. He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported. The dry and sunny weather this year has led to alarger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year. The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s. Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation. That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather. However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on. But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does ""potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,"" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues. At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be. There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week. Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions. Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies. By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies. Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas. If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes. In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976. Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought. Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed. And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms. Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than £1m. It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions. But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult. A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs. He added: ""Over £104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer. That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.

685857,Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8074ry1yr5o#comments,"As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest. A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. ""I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,"" he said. "" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action."" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Though not officially classed as a ""big cat"" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. ""Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,"" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. ""Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,"" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. ""Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,"" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. ""If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,"" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. ""Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,"" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. ""Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals."" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. ""We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements."" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

830436,Sandeel fishing ban to remain in place,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxxzxkjo,"A challenge to Britain's ban on commercial fishing for sandeels in the North Sea has been dismissed in an international court. Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline. Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low. Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was ""discriminatory and disproportionate"", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place andgave evidence in the court hearing. Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: ""We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound."" ""Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery."" The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)welcomedthe court's decision and said it had found ""the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science"". Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production. Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was ""unnecessary"" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence. Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a ""massive impact"" on the industry. ""It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,"" he said. Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat. ""Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,"" he added. The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuingconcerns about the seabird population. Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: ""Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it. ""The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that."" The Permanent Court of Arbitrationruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was ""disproportionate"". In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it ""provides clarity"" on fishing rights. It said: ""The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take"". A Defra spokesperson said it would ""bring the UK into compliance"" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.

913290,White storks hatch in Cornwall in rewilding plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80k543ezrpo,"A farmer is nurturing a brood of white stork chicks as part of a charity's aim to reintroduce them in the county. Yan Swiderski has welcomed eight stork chicks from the adults he keeps in a woodland near Wadebridge as part of work by the Cornwall Stork Project. Wildlife expert Chris Packham said the project was ""exciting"" as it would ""hopefully recolonise Cornwall"" with the birds. Thefirst wild white stork chicks in the UK for hundreds of years hatchedat the Knepp Estate in West Sussex in 2020. Wildlife expert Chris Packham said reintroducing storks was ""something that's not easy to do"". He said: ""You can't just get some storks and let them go in the UK because they will only return to where they were hatched. ""This is what is so exciting about the storks in Wadebridge. ""Because those storks have hatched there, when they're released they'll have a yearn to return to Wadebridge or the surrounding area which will mean they will hopefully recolonise Cornwall."" White storkshave been seen flying across Cornwallas they migrate south.  Mr Packham said migration was tough as some storks could be hunted and some affected by natural catastrophes. ""This is a project which needs to run for a number of years to get those numbers up because there will be natural mortality. ""So the idea that all eight of these storks that migrate away when they're released will make it back is a little fanciful."" Storks are slow to mature, he added, so breeding would take a while. A few of the chicks born near Wadebridge were fragile and needed specialist care from the nearby Screech Owl Sanctuary. Karen Hopkins, who is caring for them, said: ""The hope is that these lovely birds will fly over the Cornish skies and we can be a small part of that process by giving them the food they need at this young age.""

215289,Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,"After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth. Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft. After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. ""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference. It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days. It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems. ""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate. Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"". The journey home took 17 hours. The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment. They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families. ""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut. ""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time."" The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space. They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message fora Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home. And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust. ""Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,"" he told the BBC. ""Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment. ""But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing."" In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home. Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: ""I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.""

246033,Will 2025 be a sweet year for strawberry growers and consumers?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpn41wxdqo,"The UK's strawberry season is off to a ""stonking start"", according to one grower, with warm days and cooler nights meaning they are sweeter than usual. Marion Regan, managing director of Kent-based Hugh Lowe Farms, told the BBC that a ""glorious spring"" this year had contributed to a ""really good crop"" of the fruit. That is good news for strawberry lovers, including those attending Wimbledon this year - one of Hugh Lowe Farms' clients. This spring is currently ranking asthe driest in over a century, according to the Met Office, with the Environment Agency recently warning there is a ""medium"" risk of a summer drought. Ms Regan, who has been growing strawberries for more than 50 years, said she was noticing that this year's were a ""good size"" so far but that the ""most marked thing"" was their sweetness. A combination of warm days and cool nights are known to make strawberries sweeter. The lower night temperatures allow them to rest and put the energy they have gained during the day into producing more natural sugars. However, Ms Regan said it remained to be seen what the rest of their growing season - which lasts until November - would bring. Asked about the warnings over potential drought conditions, she said that she, like all good soft fruit growers, have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather and to ensure their crops get a steady supply with water. Nevertheless, some help from mother nature would not go amiss. ""All farmers could do with the rain, it would be nice,"" she added. Pauline Goodall, a strawberry farmer from Limington in Somerset, told the BBC earlier this month that a warmer than average start to May was having a noticeable effect on the timing of this year's harvest. ""They're just ripening at a phenomenal rate,"" she said of her strawberries. The Summer Berry Company, based in Colworth near Chichester, recently said that the warmer weather had helped increase its production to 200 tonnes – 50 tonnes more than by the same time last year - and that the plants were producing ""lush-sweet tasting fruit"". This all bodes well for consumers keen to get their berry fix over summer, but how should we be making the most of these sweet flavours? While some people may prefer to keep it classic with cream, there are other options available for those who are looking to be more adventurous. According to the BBC Food,a little black pepper or balsamic vinegar helps to give them more flavour, while pairing them with some form of chilli can help balance the flavours out. This year marks a very different start to the strawberry-growing season than in 2024, when the fruit was delayed in ripening following one of the wettest winters on record. Scientists have saidclimate change was a major factorin this weather. It is also well-established that human-caused climate change is making spells of hot weather more likely, and that hot days have become more common in the UK. Over the decade 2014-2023, days exceeded 28C more than twice as often as the 1961-1990 average, according to the Met Office. BBC Weather forecaster Chris Fawkes saidthe coming weekshould provide some good strawberry-growing weather with long spells of sunshine and cool nights. A few showers could come in the first half of the week, and some could turn to thunder and hail, which would not be welcomed by growers although the risk to individual farms would be very low.

269842,Endangered axolotl release raises hopes for rare amphibian,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xr2jzelyo,"One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered. In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City. The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they ""survived and foraged successfully at both sites"" - even gaining weight. Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an ""amazing result"". The findings are publishedin the journal PLoS Oneand they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat. The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians. But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild. ""If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,"" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico. It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander. ""If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,"" Dr Zambrano continued, ""I feel that we have hope for humanity."" To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland ""refuges"" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water, The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an ""artificial wetland"". Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device. ""The amazing news is that they all survived,"" Dr Ramos told BBC News. ""And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting."" The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. ""We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,"" Dr Ramos explained. Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. ""Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,"" said Dr Ramos. ""And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. ""You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.""

931066,Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6yg204pvmo,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017,a government report statedthat systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has beenput at £1.4bn each day– no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on boardcarried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

492131,Movement controls brought in over bluetongue virus,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787jyg981no,"Movement restrictions have been placed on cattle, sheep and some other livestock in Lancashire following the discovery of bluetongue virus in the county. Bluetongue virus, which is mainly spread by midge bites, does not affect humans or risk food safety. In rare instances, however, dogs and other carnivores can contract it if they consume infected substances such as aborted material and afterbirth. Restrictions were introduced on Sunday. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has not yet responded to a request from the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) for further details. Lancashire has joined several other parts of England already covered by a Defra-designated ""restricted zone"" designed to stem the spread of the disease. Within restricted zones, there are strict controls on the movement of animals classed as ruminants. These include sheep, cattle, goats and deer as well as camelids such as llamas and alpacas. Bluetongue is classed as a ""notifiable"" disease, meaning it is an offence not to report it to the authorities. Livestock owners have been told to keep a close watch for bluetongue and to report any suspicions to Defra. Under the newly introduced rules, ruminating animals and camelids can only be moved out of a restricted zone if permitted to do so by a vet. No livestock can be moved within a control zone if there are clinical signs of bluetongue. Dairy cattle may be moved from the restricted zone to their usual milking parlour and returned directly to their place of origin – provided they go by foot to and from what is the regular place of milking used for the relevant herd. Signs of bluetongue in sheep include ulcers or sores in the mouth and nose, discharge from the eyes or nose and drooling from mouth, and the swelling of the lips, tongue, head and neck, as well as the coronary band (where the skin of the leg meets the horn of the foot). Other symptoms include red skin as a result of blood collecting beneath the surface, fever, lameness, breathing problems, abortion, foetal deformities and stillbirths. The disease can be fatal. Lambs can become infected with bluetongue virus before birth if the dam is infected while pregnant. Signs of infection include lambs born small, weak, deformed or blind. They can die within a few days of birth, and some can be stillborn. In cattle, signs of bluetongue include lethargy, crusty erosions around the nostrils and muzzle, and redness of the mouth, eyes and, nose;. Additionally, there can be reddening of the skin above the hoof, nasal discharge, reddening and erosions on the teats, fever, milk drop, and a loss of appetite. Cows may abort their calves and there can be foetal deformities and stillbirths. Adult cattle may be infectious for several weeks while showing little or no sign of disease. They are often the preferred host for the biting midges that carry and transmit bluetongue virus. Like lambs, calves can become infected with bluetongue virus before birth if the mother is infected while pregnant. Signs of infection include calves born small, weak, deformed or blind. Some infected calves die within a few days of birth, while others are stillborn. Listen to the best ofBBC Radio Lancashire on Soundsand follow BBC Lancashire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

587104,Exceptionally low river levels raise fears over water supplies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkn7rjv7zo,"Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses. The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century. Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales. The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions. The next 2-3 weeks will be ""crucial"" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group. That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way. The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt. Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year. ""We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,"" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk. He had to start irrigating his fields in March. ""We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,"" he said. He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported. The dry and sunny weather this year has led to alarger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year. The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s. Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation. That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather. However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on. But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does ""potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,"" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues. At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be. There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week. Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions. Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies. By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies. Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas. If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes. In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976. Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought. Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed. And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms. Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than £1m. It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions. But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult. A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs. He added: ""Over £104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer. That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.

521434,One garden's hectic journey to Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4r382r6no,"Months of hard work and a hectic journey have been stepping stones for one South West garden display, the creators of which say they are ""overwhelmed"" to finally make it to the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. First-time entrants Nick and Hannah Wade, from Gardeners Delight Nursery in Barnstaple, Devon, are just a few of up to 145,000 people visiting the iconic event over the next week. Their display will be competing for one of four types of medals, an outcome decided by the competition judging panels. Hannah said she was ""overwhelmed"" to finally be able to take part. ""My stress levels have now ceased because now we can stand back and look at our display, and I feel I can finally relax,"" said Hannah. The display includes many different types of the Geum plant species, such as the Totally Tangerine and the Prinses Juliana. She said: ""We wanted to plant planters for people with not much garden or no garden at all. ""You can use any size container and add a few flowers to helps the bees, butterflies and dragonflies, and, if everyone just had one plant by their front door, it would really help."" Nick said that, despite the process of organising, actually executing the plan was a ""hectic"" affair. He said: ""We did the five-hour drive, unloaded the vans, and at 10pm turned up at our accommodation, only to realise the host wouldn't answer to give us the key code to get in. ""We managed to book another hotel for one night, but got ourselves locked in Battersea Park along the way. ""We then had to climb the railings to get out, and, after accidentally leaving one of our bags in the park, we finally got to our room at one in the morning."" Cornish water feature sculptor Jeremy Hastings is also at this year's show, and said he was expecting a large volume of visitors. He said: ""It's been a whirlwind. ""Yesterday we were up to our elbows in mud just sorting out the plants, and today we're in our best clothes and it's totally different. ""We've had some leaflets go out, but for the rest of the week it will be shoulder to shoulder and you won't be able to see much of the floor. He has partnered with Steve and Lucy from Kits Nursery in St Columb. Steve said: ""We just wanted to pick plants which would represent plants you'd see a lot of in Cornwall. ""We've got Armerias, Hostas, a selection of grasses, coastal perennials and nepetas."" Jeremy added that the flower show was essential for business every year, and emphasised the difference the plants made. ""The flowers are so important because it gives people an idea of what these spheres could look like in their gardens,"" he said.

1112375,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno#comments,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

144011,Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8074ry1yr5o,"As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest. A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. ""I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,"" he said. "" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action."" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Though not officially classed as a ""big cat"" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. ""Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,"" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. ""Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,"" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. ""Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,"" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. ""If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,"" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. ""Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,"" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. ""Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals."" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. ""We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements."" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

141725,The wonderful wildlife in Belfast that will be captured on camera,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98p31x06ewo,"Despite being a large city, Belfast is home to a surprising amount of wildlife. Television presenter Iolo Williams is determined to seek out its rich and varied urban characters and meet the people keen to keep the city wonderfully wild. ""It's always good when you visit somewhere which has got a big population with wildlife in the middle of it, because most people now live in towns and in cities,"" he said. Williams will be undertaking a three-week nature trek through some of Northern Ireland's most diverse wildlife hotspots as part of the 20th anniversary of BBC Springwatch. The series will return to BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from Monday 26 May, led by Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan. There will be three weeks of live programmes set in the National Trust's Longshaw Estate in the heart of the Peak District but it will also feature three places in Northern Ireland: Belfast, Rathlin Island and Mount Stewart in County Down. Williams added: ""It's great for us to show things like golden eagles and white-tailed eagles and basking sharks, but wildlife for most people is what they see in their gardens or in their local parks or in town."" After Belfast, Williams will travel by ferry to Rathlin Island, a biodiversity hotspot and Northern Ireland's most northerly point. It is a vital breeding ground for a variety of seabirds and home to endemic species such as the mysterious golden hare. Williams will also hope to hear the call of the rare corncrake. Williams said: ""It's a migratory bird which 100, 120 years ago was really common. It's now declining throughout its range in Europe. ""It has disappeared from Wales, hanging on in one or two places in England, and just hanging on in the wilder parts of the west coast, mainly of Scotland, and it's holding on in Ireland as well."" At Mount Stewart, Williams will introduce viewers to a range of wildlife. There are 10,000 recorded species at Mount Stewart which has diverse woodlands, ghost ponds, rough farmland fields, twisting hedgerows, and a tidal lough scattered with green islands. Throughout the series, live nest-cameras rigged across springtime locations will tell the story of the season alongside a range of pre-recorded films, which have been capturing moments of spring 2025. Springwatch will continue to reveal an insight into the lives of wildlife, and with 20 years behind it, the programme will build a clear picture of how wildlife has changed since it began filming as well as make some predictions for its future. The programme's executive producer, Rosemary Edwards, said: ""Filming in new locations is always a challenge. ""But getting to know the wildlife there and uncovering new, uplifting stories about our native flora and fauna is something that never ceases to excite us."" BBC Springwatch returns at the following times: Mon 26 May – Thursday 29 May at 20:00 GMT Mon 2 June – Thursday 5 June at 20:00 Mon 9 June – Thursday 12 June at 20:00 A patient speaks out as a charity warns of record levels of heart disease in Northern Ireland.

882631,Plan to help revitalise town's freshwater lake,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv15grq4rlo,"A grant to help revitalise Yorkshire's largest freshwater lake has been secured by a community and environmental charity. Groundwork Yorkshire said Hornsea Mere, located within the Wassand Hall estate in East Yorkshire, faced a number of environmental challenges, including deteriorating water quality, invasive non-native species and recreational use. It said the funding would be used to work with partners to develop an action plan for the entire catchment area, with practical conservation work planned, including the removal of invasive species. The award is from the government's Water Restoration Fund, which offers grants for area specific water-related schemes. The charity's regional operations director Peter Murphy said the lake was an important area for wildlife, especially waterfowl. He added: ""We are delighted to have this opportunity to work collaboratively on the production of a development plan for the mere and its catchment, with a view to securing further funding to deliver meaningful and long-lasting changes."" As part of the project, community volunteers are also being encouraged to get involved. The project team has set up a dedicated contactemailfor anyone who may be interested.

671759,Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo,"Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. China's Long March 5B boosterre-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and theTiangong-1 space stationmostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018. Kosmos 482 is now being closely tracked by international space agencies. Mr Lemmens said that future spacecraft ""should be designed in such a way that they can take themselves out of orbit safely, preferably by doing controlled re-entries"". This would allow for precise predictions of landing locations, reducing the risk of any debris impacting populated areas and protecting people and property while ""managing the environmental impact of space debris"".

333159,The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30mjedjzgpo,"Listen to Esme read this article Donald Trump's return to the White House is a ""major blow to global climate action"". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November. Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets. Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a ""green new scam"". And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada – both nations rich in critical minerals. Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology. So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector? Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla – the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets). Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium. She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors. Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: ""Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve."" He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow. The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: ""The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China."" Failure to do so, it warned, could cause ""defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies"". China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers. ""China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,"" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. ""You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country."" Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply – like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray. China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock). ""China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,"" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten. What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,"" he says. ""It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money."" As he puts it, it is a ""happy coincidence"" that this could end up supporting green technology. The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector. In the early days, the green transition was ""framed as a burden"" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward. The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels. By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (£382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor. And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer. But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening. ""The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,"" explains Ms Gray. ""Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US."" There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a ""Critical Minerals Executive Order"", which could funnel further investment into this objective. The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants. Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. ""If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years."" As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed ""big, beautiful bill"" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month. Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment. MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the ""battery belt"" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive. He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years. If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation. Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. ""In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA."" He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA – although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. ""If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess."" But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. ""When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement."" For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.

946684,Energy boss warns over future of gas storage facility,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mrwdzvrmzo,"The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC. Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be ""shut down"" without government help over energy pricing. Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose £100m this year, and it wants to invest £2bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen. The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals. The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas. It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in ""constructive discussions"" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed. The company is seeking a ""cap and floor"" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high. ""What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock £2bn of investment,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC. ""It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore."" Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned ""and we'll lose this resilience"". He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six. ""So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days."" A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, ""we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers"". Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not ""materially"" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels. He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a ""huge economic opportunity"". However he added that ""the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments"". ""Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price."" He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was ""very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target"". ""It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills."" Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the £4.5m pay he received the previous yearwas ""impossible to justify"". And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans. When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: ""I don't set my own pay. ""I think it's really difficult,"" he said. ""I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done."" Experts say the UK has enough gas after Centrica said storage levels were ""concerningly low"". Albert Taylor says his fight for a British Gas refund was like ""banging my head against a brick wall"". Yeovil Athletic Club is ""futureproofed"" with the latest in technology in a bid to reduce running costs. The firm told a man it was sending his details to a debt collector over an incorrect £2,500 bill. Centrica says it is installing four ultra-efficient hydrogen-ready engines at its site in Brigg.

620150,Decades-long mystery of ginger cats revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywdjjgvqqo,"Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse – cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly. And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour. They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours. The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research. The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions. It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now. Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous paperspublished on Thursday. What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active. Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function. By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene. Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.  For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes. As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger. In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely. ""These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,"" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University. ""As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches."" Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki. He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could ""contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases"". He and his team raised 10.6m yen (£55,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world. One contributor wrote: ""We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats."" The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development. The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament. The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss. ""Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,"" said Prof Sasaki. ""There's no scientific evidence for this yet, but it's an intriguing idea and one I'd love to explore further."" It is the second to be born there since October and is vital for the breed's future, keepers say. Animal rescuers say there is an increase in the number of cats not being neutered and them dumped. The job ad requires the successful candidate to play classical music to the cat on Fridays. The breed is known for distinctive spiky yellow eyebrows.

290032,Climate experts criticise handling of Tata changes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ezrvd9neo,"The UK's climate change advisors have criticised the handling of a switch to greener steelmaking at the country's largest plant in Port Talbot, which resulted in huge job losses. Government ministers should have been better at planning ahead and making sure other green jobs were available locally, the experts said. The independentClimate Change Committee(CCC) has set out its latest advice on how Walesreaches net zero- with a push for more electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting. The Welsh and UK governments said they had been working together to develop ""a strong vision"" for the region's future and deliver ""our clean energy superpower mission"". More than 2,000 jobs were lost at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks following the closure of its blast furnaces in 2024. The move broughtan end to traditional steelmaking at the site, as the company grappled with losses of over £1m a day. It was given a £500m grant by the UK government and is now investing £1.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027. This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site. The changes will havea dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gasesfrom Wales. The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC. But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry. In its report, the CCC said there were ""important lessons to learn"", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared. ""The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,"" they argued. The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened ""early and collaborative"" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said. The Welsh government could have ensured ""the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure"", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind. The committee said Port Talbot's experience should now be used ""to guide future efforts to decarbonise other strategically and locally-significant emissions-intensive industries,"" citing Pembroke's oil refineries as an example. Former steelworker Shaun Spencer, who now works for a firm training electrical engineers, said he agreed with the committee's comments ""100%"". He warned the feeling of ""resentment and bitterness"" was ""very strong"" among his former colleagues. He added the approach had been detrimental to ""everybody's views of net zero"" and to support for the way the UK and Welsh governments deal with things, ""especially in this area"". Emma Pinchbeck, the CCC's chief executive, told BBC news what had happened at Port Talbot was ""foreseeable and preventable"", and had ""not been the best case study"" for what a green transition should look like. Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as ""carbon budgets"", and how each UK nation might achieve this. Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35. The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990. Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan. Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live. The CCC has made 16 ""priority"" recommendations for immediate action. These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport. By 2033 - in just eight years' time - a third of cars and vans on Welsh roads should be electric, the committee said, and nearly a quarter of existing homes need a heat pump or similar technology. The committee also said the Welsh government will need to support farmers and rural communities to ""diversify their income"" away from livestock farming and towards woodland creation and peatland restoration. In 2022, agriculture was the third-highest emitting sector in Wales, accounting for 16% of Wales' emissions. Cattle and sheep numbers should fall by 19% by 2033 due to changes in agricultural policy but also a shift in diets with less meat and dairy consumed UK-wide, the report has predicted. The proportion of woodland cover across Wales will rise from 15% to 17% in 2033 and 26% by 2050, according to the committee's projections. Farming union NFU Cymru said the Welsh government needed to ""reflect and consider"" whether that advice fit ""with the circumstances we have in Wales"". ""Many thousands of people rely on agriculture and livestock production,"" said the union's president Aled Jones. The Welsh government thanked the CCC for the report which it said it would now ""review and use to set Carbon Budget 4 in regulation before the end of the year"". A spokesman said it had been working with the UK government, the local authority and key stakeholders as part of the Tata Steel UK transition board to support affected individuals and businesses and develop a ""strong vision for the future of the region"". It hoped do this by ""making the most of"" opportunities from new infrastructure and investment in areas such as renewable energy, he added. The UK government said it had committed £2.5bn ""to rebuild the steel industry for decades to come as it decarbonises"". ""Decarbonisation should not mean deindustrialisation and we will ensure a bright and sustainable future for UK steelmaking,"" a spokesman added. ""We will work with the Welsh government as we deliver our clean energy superpower mission and accelerate to net zero, growing our economy and making working people better off."" David Ejimofor, 15, told friends he couldn't swim before entering the water, an inquest hears. Guildford Borough Council says conservation work at Tyting Farm will help it to achieve net zero.

756365,Wild chimpanzees filmed using forest 'first aid',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj7ln85vxwo,"Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants - in multiple ways - to treat open wounds and other injuries. University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate. The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use ""forest first aid"". Researchers say the study, which is published in the journalFrontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild. Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was ""a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene"". ""Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,"" she explained. ""The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury."" The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body. They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, ""because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy"". Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala. This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s – local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed. There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs. There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating. This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties. Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound. Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines. ""The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,"" Dr Freymann told BBC News. ""If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick."" ""But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings.""

222610,Secrets of forgotten Egyptian tomb statue revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj434djvpgo,"A stone head that spent decades gathering dust on a wall has proved to be an Egyptian statue from an ancient tomb. The statue fragment was one of hundreds of pieces, from a fossilised shark tooth to wartime posters, collected by a Nottinghamshire doctor. When inspected, the relic was found to be mounted on a wooden board, which revealed it was 2,500 years old but also contained documents showing it was found in 1888 close to a ""lost"" pyramid. Valuer Richard Griza said: ""I saw it over my shoulder, and I almost couldn't believe my eyes - it is a privilege to handle such an item."" The artefact, measuring roughly 15cm (6in) square, is believed to be part of an ""ushabti"", a type of funerary figure which was intended to function as a helper in the afterlife. Made of volcanic basalt, it has been dated to the 26th Dynasty (circa 664-525BC). Mr Griza, from Arthur Johnson and Sons auctioneers, said the items had been collected by a local doctor. ""There were hundreds of items, and they were eclectic to say the least,"" he said. ""He seemed to have collected historical curios of all sorts, from sword handles to fossilised shark teeth. ""The head had been on a wall for decades, and the gentleman's niece said they didn't pay much attention to it; it was just another thing to dust."" It was only when taken off the wall, it was found the wooden mounting contained documents revealing more about its past. The paperwork, drawings, and letters of provenance show it was found during Flinders Petrie's 1888 excavations at Hawara. It came from the tomb of a great noble called Horuta, who was important enough to be buried close to the pyramid of pharaoh Amenemhat II, which has been largely destroyed over time. Mr Griza said: ""It is so rare to get an item with this provenance. ""We know where and when it was found, and it's so remarkable it was found by one of the pioneers in archaeology."" Sir Flinders Petrie, who lived from 1853 until 1942, is regarded as one of the most important and influential figures in the history of Egyptology. He pioneered a more scientific approach to both dating finds and regarding anything found on an excavation - no matter how mundane - as worthy of study. Some of the collection has already been sold, but the head goes under the hammer at Arthur Johnson and Sons auctioneers on 24 May with an estimate of £1,500 to £2,500.

82939,Farmers say NI pollution proposals 'out of touch',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4z6wq3l3xo,"Farmers have said plans to reduce water pollution as a result of agricultural activity are ""out of touch"" with the reality of agriculture. Northern Ireland's long-overdue Nutrients Action Programme (NAP) for 2026-29 has been published for consultation. Many of the proposals are linked to the Lough Neagh Action Plan. Making low emission slurry spreading equipment (LESSE) mandatory and placing restrictions on the use of phosphorus fertiliser are among recommended revisions. President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, William Irvine, said it was ""deeply concerning"" the proposals from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) ""lean heavily"" towards enforcement and regulation rather than education, incentives or collaboration with farmers. ""Farmers are not shying away from their responsibilities,"" he said. ""For the last 20 years, since NAP was first introduced, we have been implementing practices to improve water quality. ""We fully recognise the need to protect and improve water quality, but it must be done in a way that's balanced, fair and grounded in the day-to-day realities of farming in NI. ""The proposals within NAP reflect a clear disconnect with local agriculture and fail to deliver what's truly needed."" Daera said it was ""widely recognised that the intensification of agricultural production has had negative impacts on the environment"". Welcoming the consultation, the Northern Ireland Environment Link (NIEL) - which represents more than120,000 individuals and the management/ownership of 314,000 acres of land - said the NAP was a ""starting point for improving NI's precious freshwater environment"". ""We recognise that delivering these changes will not be easy and acknowledge the challenge that many farmers face in adapting to new restrictions and practices, particularly amid rising costs and a continuously shifting policy and regulation landscape,"" a spokesperson said. ""That's why we're calling for a strong programme of advice, investment and long-term support to enable a just and workable transition."" Daera Minister Andrew Muir said action was needed to improve water quality and meet legal obligations. ""This is why it is essential to review NAP and consider additional measures to reduce the overall phosphorus surplus in our agricultural system,"" he said. ""The main additional measures include further restrictions on use of chemical phosphorus fertiliser and a farm phosphorus balance limit for more intensive farms."" He added that while 62% of the nutrient load in waterways could be traced back to to agriculture, other sources such as wastewater treatment and septic tank seepages also play a role. His department also wants to ""enhance"" the enforcement powers available to it, to apply fixed or variable monetary penalties for breaches of the NAP. Speaking onBBC's The View, Muir said he recognised that the measures proposed in the NAP are ""challenging"" and the consultation is ""very complex"". ""Ultimately we do need to change so we can improve our waterways and I don't want to consign Lough Neagh to the scenes we've seen in recent years,"" Muir said. He added that since NI Water was established in 2007 they have had a ""permission to pollute"". He added that he was ""fed up"" with thelack of investment in wastewater infrastructure, and that the Infrastructure Minister Liz Kimmins ""needs to get her head out of the sand and needs to turn the situation around"". ""What I am being left with as the minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs is the job of cleaning up the sewage that NI Water are pumping into our waterways."" On Friday, the minister announced that the consultation would be extended to 12 weeks and will now close on 24 July. ""I recognise that the proposals in the revised NAP have a level of complexity because of the detailed science and evidence underpinning them,"" he said. ""Therefore, having listened to the concerns from farmers and industry about the need for more time to consider the consultation proposals, I am extending the consultation period by four weeks."" Muir said the extension is an ""important opportunity"" for people to respond or offer alternative proposals, and stressed that no final decisions have yet been made. Intensive farms – mostly dairy and some beef farms - can be granted a derogation for using slurry on their land, allowing them to apply up to 250kg nitrogen per hectare per year from grazing livestock manures, rather than 170kg. The number of farms that currently have a derogation is 427. The lower limit for nitrogen would be reduced to 150kg/N/ha/year, putting another 3,100 farms in the category. In total, the consultation document said, these farms account for 17% of all farms, yet produce some 50% of total manure nitrogen. They will also represent a significant proportion of surplus phosphorus because of their greater reliance on feed inputs. These farms would also be subject to a Phosphorus Balance Limit of 10kg/ha/year in 2027, reducing to 8kg in 2029. Other schemes seeking ways of better using slurry and the nutrients it contains include the sustainable use of livestock slurry and using slurry to generate biogas.

121940,Anti-sewage campaigners stage 'paddle out protest',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2491rlr49do,"Water quality campaigners have staged a ""paddle out protest"" on Bristol Harbour to demand an overhaul of the water industry to cut sewage spills. Organised by environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, protestors gathered at Baltic Wharf with signs reading ""species not faeces"" and ""waste in the water - otterly disgusting"". It was one of more than 40 similar protests around the UK calling for an end to raw sewage discharge into waterways, and clearer monitoring and transparency of spills. Wessex Water said it was spending £3m a month to reduce the use of storm overflows, which it said discharged ""mostly rainwater or groundwater"" and were used ""to protect properties from flooding"". One protestor said she just wanted to be able to swim in the waters around Bristol ""without thinking I'm going to get ill"". Anna Steele-Perkins told BBC Bristol: ""It's actually quite an anxious experience to swim around Bristol -I've got to keep my head above water and I've got a lot of friends who have got quite ill from doing it."" She added that she monitors sewage spills on the SAS app, but added: ""I don't want to have to do that, I just want to be able to swim."" SAS Bristol member Karlie Evans said: ""I'm a huge water user. I'm a rower, I paddle board, I surf, I swim. I just want to be able to use the water safely."" The protest coincides with the start of the official bathing season in England and Wales, which runs from 15 May to 30 September. Water companies spilled raw sewage for a record 3.61m hours into sea and rivers in England in 2024, according to data from the Environment Agency. Giles Bristow, chief executive at Surfers Against Sewage said: ""Another year, another summer of swimming and surfing in sewage while our shameless water companies laugh all the way to the bank."" He added: ""Our failing water industry has been trumpeting billions in investment to clean up their act, but we know that these fat cat bosses can't be trusted to keep their promises."" Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Steve Reed, said: ""I share the public's anger about the appalling state our waterways have been left in after years of neglect."" He added: ""The landmark Water Act is now law, meaning polluting water bosses face up to two years in prison and undeserved multi-million-pound bonuses will be banned."" An Environment Agency spokesperson said: ""Last year, nearly 92% of bathing waters met minimum standards, but we all want to see better bathing water quality. ""That's why we welcome the opportunity to improve their management through the incoming reforms and the re-opening of new site applications."" The water companies serving the region, Thames Water and Wessex Water, have been approached for comment. A Thames Water spokesperson said the company will investing a record amount over the next five years to increase treatment capacity, reduce the number of discharges caused by storms and also tackle nutrient pollution. The spokesperson said: ""We are committed to seeing waterways thrive, but we can't do it alone. ""Farming, industry, road runoff, wildlife and increasingly extreme weather also play a role in river health."" They added: ""We understand that all untreated discharges are unacceptable, even when they are permitted, the sewage system was historically designed to prevent sewage backing up into people's homes.

640887,Hydro marks 10 years of green electricity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd29jpr2q5o,"It is 10 years since Osney Lock Hydro - the first community-owned hydro to be built on the Thames – started generating electricity. It produces an average of 165MWh of electricity each year, enough to power 60 homes. Solar panels on the roof contribute another 8MWh. The facility in Oxford is managed by volunteers with a contractor providing technical support. Most of the £690,000 it cost to build the hydro was raised from members of the local community through a series of share offers. Hydropower uses the power of flowing water, such as rivers and streams, to turn turbines, which in turn power generators. All the electricity generated at the Oxford site is consumed by the Environment Agency's Osney depot and the community on Osney Island. The facility is open to the public Friday to Sunday and there are information boards and a digital display explaining how the hydro works. Barbara Hammond, one of the founding directors, said: ""The project was initially conceived in 2001 and it's been an incredible journey with amazing contributions from so many people. ""We believe passionately in the role community energy can play in helping reach net zero."" A fish pass, built as part of the project, has allowed fish to move up and down the river at Osney for the first time in 200 years. The garden is managed with wildlife in mind, with a hedge of native UK species, a wild meadow and a flower border which is a feast for bees. Architect David Hammond, a driving force in the original project, designed the powerhouse and garden area. He died in 2023 and is commemorated at the site by an oak bench. Osney Lock Hydro is owned by West Oxford Community Renewables (WOCoRe), a registered society, run for the benefit of the community. In addition to the hydro, WOCoRe operates solar PV arrays on the King's Centre, an Aldi supermarket and Matthew Arnold School. These installations were funded, like the hydro, through community share offers. Money generated from the society's assets is used to promote carbon cutting measures in the local community and to fund nature recovery projects. The society has a board of volunteer directors elected by the shareholders. As a registered society, WOCoRe exists for the benefit of the community. It delivers those benefits through generating clean energy, showcasing the potential of community energy, supporting local wildlife, and through grants to local community organisations.

479295,Yorkshire Dales village shaken by earthquake,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge3ywnxxro,"Residents of a North Yorkshire village have said they were left shaken in their beds by an early morning earthquake. The 2.5-magnitude quake was recorded just after 01:30 BST on Friday to the south west of Litton in the Yorkshire Dales, and it had a depth of 2.5 miles (4km), according to the British Geological Survey (BGS). Earthquakes below a magnitude of 2.5 can sometimes only be picked up with monitoring equipment, but the quake in the Dales was reportedly felt by a number of people in the village and surrounding area. Sandra Lund, from Litton, said it was the ""weirdest experience"" she and her husband had ever had. ""There was a huge bang, it sounded like an explosion,"" she said. ""My husband is actually deaf and he still heard it - that's how loud it was. ""We were looking for smoke, we were dumbfounded. Then everything was just still."" Mrs Lund said neither of them felt anything else afterwards, but she was left unable to sleep as she was ""convinced something had blown up"". Meanwhile, Debbie Roe said she was woken by the sound of two loud bangs which she first thought was ""my cats jumping off the bed"". ""But they were probably the bangs other people heard, and then there was a low rumbling for maybe 10 seconds,"" she explained. Another local resident told the BBC she and her husband experienced ""a loud rumbling noise and the ground shaking"". However, she added that ""it didn't last long at all"". For heavier sleepers, however, online chatter on Friday morning was the first they had heard of any seismic activity in the area. Councillor Richard Foster said he ""didn't hear anything, I slept right through"". Davie Galloway, BGS seismologist, said the organisation received reports that the quake had sounded like ""a large truck coming up the lane"". ""Each year, between 200 and 300 earthquakes are detected and located in the UK by the BGS,"" he said. ""Between 20 to 30 earthquakes are felt by people each year and a few hundred smaller ones are only recorded by sensitive instruments, like the Litton earthquake this morning."" He said that although the Yorkshire Dales are distant from the nearest plate boundary, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, earthquakes could occur as forces acting on tectonic plates were relieved by movement on pre-existing fault planes. ""While UK earthquakes tend to be relatively small, no one can be complacent and the BGS keeps a database for use in seismic assessment and to provide near-immediate responses to significant events, if and when required,"" Mr Galloway added. The last earthquake recorded in North Yorkshire was at Kilnsey in Wharfedale on 18 March, which had a magnitude of two. On Tuesday, the BGS recorded a 1.2-magnitude earthquake in Cardiff. Listen to highlights fromNorth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look North. The quake damaged homes and public buildings, and caused widespread power cuts. The behaviour is known as an 'alert circle', a formation meant to protect elephant calves from threats. There are no reports of injuries or major damage after the quake struck on Monday morning. The UN received reports that Myanmar's military had conducted attacks, while the military accused rebels of the same. More than 3,000 people have been confirmed dead after last week's earthquake and the toll is expected to rise. Copyright 2025 BBC.

565145,'Quite a surprise' to spot 4ft shark swimming in river,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23m4l3rjj3o,"A man has said he ""couldn't believe"" what he was seeing when he came across a shark swimming in an east Belfast river. Thomas Davidson was cycling through Victoria Park on Tuesday evening when he spotted a 4ft-long starry smooth-hound shark in the Connswater River, where the waterway meets Belfast Lough. The species of shark has been seen in other urban areas such as theRiver Thamesand theRiver Mersey estuary. Dr Patrick Collins, a marine biologist at Queen's University, said while ""it's not something you see everyday, it's not something super unusual either"". ""In the past I would occasionally have seen several 2-3lb mullet follow the tide in, but on this occasion I saw a much larger shape in the water adjacent to Airport Road,"" Mr Davidson told BBC News NI. He said this shape was ""too big to be a mullet"", so he stopped to take a closer look. ""A dorsal fin slowly broke the surface revealing that familiar profile that looked like a shark,"" he said. ""I quickly took out my phone and started to video this slow-moving fish as it meandered left and right up and downstream, getting mobbed by a few gulls. ""I couldn't believe what I was watching."" The shark continued swimming in this section of river for about 30 minutes before moving upstream into a shadow area and Mr Davidson lost sight of it. ""I felt very lucky to witness such a lengthy sighting and was left curious as to how far upstream it might go,"" he said. TheConnswater Riverrises in the Castlereagh hills and runs northwards through east Belfast, getting wider until it reaches the sea at Belfast Lough. The river route includes the Connswater Greenway walking route and flows past CS Lewis Square and Connswater Shopping Centre. Mr Davidson said it was ""quite a surprise"" and he will ""continue to look out for it and others in the future"". This type of shark mainly eat crabs and small crustaceans, marine biologist Dr Patrick Collins said. The section of the river in Victoria Park probably contained crabs, and so this shark spotted by Mr Davidson was ""probably just having its lunch"", he explained. He said it is ""not very common to find smooth-hounds in cities, but they have been recorded in the last few years"". ""It's a little bit unusual if you're walking your dog to find one that close to the city, and that easy to see, but they're not a rare animal,"" Dr Collins continued. ""They're found fairly commonly across the UK and Ireland. It's not an unusual occurrence to have them close to an urban centre because there's sea water there. ""It's a bit like seeing a deer in farmland."" He added thatthis type of sharkposes no risk to the public. ""Because of movies like Jaws and some other strange public perceptions coming from that, there's this idea that all sharks are dangerous animals - they're a type of fish. ""These animals pose absolutely no threat to us whatsoever."" A patient speaks out as a charity warns of record levels of heart disease in Northern Ireland.

The northern rockhopper penguin was named Noisy by Whipsnade Zoo staff as he constantly chirps whenever they are near. Due to the low survival rate of previous eggs, the keepers placed it in an incubator and left the parents with a dummy egg so the colony could continue to practice nesting. Whipsnade Zoo's section manager of birds, Tim Savage, said contributing to the European breeding programme was ""vital"" He explained: ""As wild populations have sadly declined by more than 57% in the last 27 years, contributing to the European breeding programme to create a healthy and genetically diverse backup population in conservation zoos is vital. ""We are one of only seven zoos in Europe to care for this rare subspecies, so we're monitoring our tiny hatchling around the clock to give it the best chance possible."" Keepers feed noisy a ""milkshake"" made of blended sprats, vitamins and saline solution that replicates the regurgitated food produced by its parents. As adults, the birds have distinctive spiky yellow eyebrows and black feathers framing their faces.

384988,Heat network scheme awarded £15.5m,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq8v4v124o,"A company developing low-carbon heating networks has been awarded £15.5m to supply civic and commercial buildings in Lincoln city centre. The government has given the money to Hemiko via its Green Heat Network Fund, which invests in innovative heating projects to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency. The heat network scheme in Lincoln will involve distributing waste heat from a data centre, using air source heat pumps to warm water that will run through underground pipes to customers. A Hemiko spokesperson said the project would create 40 local jobs over the first five years of the network being built, with construction expected to begin in spring 2026 if plans are approved. Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh said: ""Heat networks will play an important role in our mission for clean power by 2030, helping us to achieve energy independence and lower bills."" Initial proposals for the scheme,detailed on the government's website, show 34 buildings in Lincoln could benefit from the project including a hospital, college, cathedral and council offices. A planning application is yet to be submitted. The company said it planned to build a new data centre to ""meet the data needs of Lincoln's businesses, while supplying cheap low carbon heat to the heat network"". It is hoped supply to the first set of customers will start in 2027. CEO Toby Heysham said the scheme would lead to a ""remarkable transformation in Lincoln"". He said: ""By drawing heat for the network from a co-located data centre, this project represents a dual revolution: the green industrial revolution and the tech revolution.

924565,Funding cuts leave national park 'near cliff edge',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyk9xyevgo,"A national park is ""close to a cliff edge"", facing cuts to education, outreach and ranger services after a reduction in its government funding, according to its boss. The chief executive of the Northumberland National Park Authority (NNPA) Tony Gates said a cut of about 8% in its revenue grant for this year comes on top of a long-term financial squeeze. ""I'm really struggling to see how we can remove £350,000 from our budget next year without cutting back some really critical services,"" Mr Gates said. The government said it had given England's 10 national parks a £15m capital uplift, calling them a ""source of national pride"". But Mr Gates said funding for the national park had fallen sharply in real terms over 15 years, forcing the closure of visitor centres and the shrinking of its team of rangers. ""We're facing the single largest cut in our revenue budget that we've had in our history,"" Mr Gates said. ""At a time when we face a nature crisis, a climate crisis and a health and wellbeing crisis for our people, the impact is likely that we're reducing the number of programmes in those areas rather than expanding them."" Steve Miller, who owns a campsite at Melkridge, said the park was vital for local tourism. He said most of his customers come to use the facilities and enjoy the countryside. ""If the National Park didn't exist it would definitely impact the amount of visitors coming,"" Mr Miller said. Mr Gates said Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs capital investment was ""very welcome"", but it still left the park struggling to cover it running costs.

562654,What is happening with Flamingo Land at Loch Lomond?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19d8kvd0m8o,"A proposed resort on the shores of Loch Lomond featuring a waterpark and monorail is set to be approved by the Scottish government, overturning the decision of the national park authority. The project wasinitially rejected last yearby Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park authority, who said it did not comply with environmental and nature conservation policies. The proposal is by theme park operator Flamingo Land. It hopes to build the £40m Lomond Banks resort, which features a monorail, waterpark, hotel and restaurants. Flamingo Land is a theme park and zoo in Yorkshire that has operated since the 1950s. The name comes from a colony of the brightly coloured birds that were among the first animals on the site at Kirby Misperton. In 2018 the company behind the park - Flamingo Land Limited - submitted proposals for a tourist development at Loch Lomond, including a hotel, craft brewery and leisure centre. The plan was met with strong opposition, with an online petition against it gathering more than 55,000 signatures. In September 2019 the company withdrew its original plans, but returned in 2020 with an updated £40m ($50m) proposal featuring a water park, monorail, swimming pool, hotel and restaurants. Throughout the process Flamingo Land has insisted that the development would not be a theme park, and council papers state that it would be a ""a major step away"" from their other resorts. More than 174,000 people signed the petition against the new proposal. The original plans were dubbed ""the most unpopular planning application in Scottish history"" by Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens MSP, and the revised proposal has proved just as controversial. Concerns have focused on whether the development would distort public green space in one of Scotland's most scenic areas. In April 2024, Lynne Somerville, the chairwoman of Balloch and Haldane Community Council, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the plans would ""dominate the whole west side of Balloch"" and be a ""living hell"" for people living locally. However, it is not just locals who are concerned, as evidenced by the number of letters sent to the council protesting against it. Others have raised fears that the vista of Loch Lomond would be affected - damaging both a stunning view and a tourist hotspot. Additional traffic in the area is another concern. Flamingo Land estimated an additional 253 cars would be on the road during rush hour times, from 17:30 until 18:30. The original proposals were unanimously objected to by West Dunbartonshire Council. However, the local authority did not oppose the proposal the second time around. That change of heart was greeted furiously by protesters. The company has also said the new proposal would feature visitor accommodation and walkways sympathetic to the local environment, and that public access would be maintained throughout the site. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency requested that lodges were removed from part of the site designated as a flood plain and questioned whether proposals to mitigate the risk of floods were ""technically feasible."" Flamingo Land stated in its plans that part of the site was exempt from the flood plain concern due to it having been in previous use as a railway line until the 1980s. Flamingo Land and Lomond Banks believe there would be considerable benefits for the local community, starting with creating around 200 jobs. They have stated that they would use local businesses throughout the construction of the development, estimated to raise £3m for the local economy. The company has made their promises to the area legally binding in a unilateral voluntary undertaking called ""the Lomond Promise."" Improvements to transport in the Loch Lomond area would also be planned, upgrading the congested Stoneymollan roundabout. Council papers state that the Ballochloan roundabout should be reprofiled as well, and that the overall development would become a ""focal point"" for Balloch. The same papers praise the possible monorail in particular. The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority board decided to reject the proposals in September. It cited the concerns over flood risks and the impact on the surrounding environment. The developers said they were disappointed by the decision, but remained committed to the project and would appeal it. The Scottish government planning reporter has sincesignalled his intention to give planning permissionfor the development, overturning the decision of the national park authority. He said the project did not conflict with the local development plan for the area, or the rules set out in the government's national planning framework. The site could operate safely despite being within a flood risk area, he said, and there could be ""locally significant"" benefits in terms of jobs and a boost to the economy. Full planning permission would only be granted if Flamingo Land and the park authority came to a legal agreement. There are 26 weeks for this agreement to be reached - and if it is not, the reporter will reconsider whether to approve or reject the application. Dr Heather Reid, convener of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park authority board, said the board would now take time to consider the implications of the report. She added: ""We stand by the reasons for the board's unanimous decision to refuse this planning application and it is deeply disappointing that the reporter has taken a different view."" The Balloch and Haldane Community Council said it would fight the decision as it ""contradicts the expressed will of the community"". Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer called the decision an ""anti-democratic outrage"" and said his party was ""urgently considering our options for continuing this fight"".

318277,Solar farm frustrated by 'zombie project' delays,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj070jpwo,"Work on a large solar farm that should have started last summer has still not begun because of delays getting it connected to the grid, a developer has said. Plans for the JAFA farm development near Swaffham in Norfolk were approved in February 2023 and it was hoped it would become operational this year. Last month, energy regulator Ofgem backed reforms to remove ""zombie projects"" from the connections queue and make it quicker for viable proposals to get hooked up to the power grid. The firm behind JAFA, Low Carbon, said it welcomed the reforms but the wait had been ""frustrating"". When the project was put before planners at Breckland District Council, it would have been one of the biggest solar farms in the country. Covering 233 acres (94 hectares), it was said it could generate enough power for 16,500 homes a year. That has been dwarfed by more recent proposals for ""megafarms"" in Norfolk, some as large as 5,000 acres (1,618 hectares). Nonetheless, there was some controversy around JAFA, with nearby Great Dunham Parish Council ""totally opposed"" to it because of the loss of good quality farmland and the visual impact on the area. But Little Dunham Parish Council gave its support to the plan, voted through by councillors on the basis that Breckland needed more low-carbon energy. Work on the site was due to start last summer, but has yet to begin as there is currently no way of connecting it to the grid. ""It is really frustrating,"" said Ed Birkett, Low Carbon's new projects director. ""There's a real issue across the industry, where there are so many projects in the grid connections queue that are waiting to connect. It's leading to really long delays - up to 10 or 12 years in some cases."" The systemhas been cloggedwith so-called ""zombie projects"" – proposals that show little sign of progressing but are in the queue for a connection. Ofgem has nowapproved reforms to the systemthat will give priority to viable developments. Asher Minns, of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, welcomed the reforms but warned there was ""a massive, massive backlog of projects"" that had been stalled across the country. ""We are so far behind on generating the green renewable energy that we need for energy security – we are decades behind where we should be,"" he said. Mr Birkett said he hoped his company could now get JAFA built and connected in ""the next one to two years"".

783801,Water testing under way as bathing season begins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kq5lepq5lo,"The Environment Agency has begun testing water quality across the South East following the start of the official bathing season. Speaking to the BBC in Hythe, Kent, Lindsay Faulkner of the Environment Agency said they were looking for bacteria, such as E.coli, that could ""make people ill"". It comes as the government body was advising against bathing in Bognor Regis, Worthing and Bexhill in Sussex, as well as Littlestone, Dymchurch and Deal in Kent due to poor water quality on Friday. However, the majority of designated bathing zones were classified by the Environment Agency as having good or excellent water quality. Ms Faulkner said there were ""multiple reasons"" why water bacteria levels might be high, such as human and animal sewage or agricultural run-off. ""We're working with local authorities, water companies and community groups to help identify sources of pollution and put a stop to them,"" she added. Water companies spilt raw sewage for arecord time of 3.61 million hoursinto seas and rivers in England in 2024, according to Environment Agency data. Southern Water, a major water supplier in the region, along with South East Water and Thames Water, said protecting and enhancing water quality was ""so important"" to the company. ""Over the last 30 years, the quality of our bathing waters has risen from only 28% meeting public health standards to 84% now rated as 'good' or 'excellent',"" it said. The water company added it would spend £1bn a year on environmental improvement over the next five years. Ms Faulkner said in some bathing zones sources of pollution were ""really easy"" to spot as it could be one pipe causing a problem. ""But the situation here [in the Dymchurch area of Kent] is that there are multiple sources,"" she added. ""It appears to be diffuse pollution."" The bathing season officially started on 15 May and will run until the end of September.

413584,Ancient Indian skeleton gets a museum home six years after excavation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nk27lng3o,"A 1,000 year-old human skeleton which was buried sitting cross-legged in India has been moved to a museum six years after it was excavated. The BBC had reportedearlier this monththat the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling. On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed. Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed. Mahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with ""utmost care"" and under the supervision of several experts. He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum. It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier. ""It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,"" Mr Surela said. Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved. Ambekar had earlier told the BBC that the skeleton was a rare discovery as similar remains had been found at only three other sites in India. But as officials argued over who should take charge of the skeleton, it remained in a make-shift tent close to the excavation site, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Experts say that the skeleton likely belongs to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE. The skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that aided preservation. Mr Ambekar said that the remains could shed light on the phenomenon of ""samadhi burials"" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried rather than cremated.

632330,Remaining peregrine falcon chick at cathedral dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6p0d74l2o,"The final surviving peregrine chick born in a nest on top of Worcester Cathedral has died. Adult birds Peter and Peggy produced four eggs at the cathedral this spring, with the first hatching on Easter Sunday - buttwo chicks diedlast week and the fourth egg failed to hatch. The remaining chick became sick and died at about 20:30 BST on Thursday, a post on Peregrine Falcons in Worcester confirmed. A 24-hour livestreamof the nest was shut down on Thursday after the bird became ill and started acting lethargically, with its parents stopping feeding it. On Facebook on Friday, Peregrine Falcons in Worcester posted that they had initially thought, before it fell ill, that the last chick had managed to avoid an unknown illness which it said had ""caused the demise of the other two"". ""Cause is unknown [for the last chick] and open to speculation until we receive results back from the lab; as stated this could take some time,"" the post went on to say. ""As feared the chick died around 20:30 last night; it has been recovered and will shortly be sent to the lab, joining its sibling for analysis."" Both adult birds appeared to be fit and healthy and would be closely monitored, they added. Thousands of people have been watching progress in the nest box on the livestream on YouTube, with nearly 500,000 people tuning in from across the world in 2024.

619445,"'Our paddleboards come out brown, it's disgusting'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nwrjzn9do,"Paddle-boarders, punters and swimmers have held protests at rivers and beaches across the East of England to call for action against sewage pollution. ""When you take the paddle boards out of the water at the end of the day, they're just brown and it's disgusting,"" said Mel Sambells at the event on Saturday in Whitlingham Broad, Norfolk. Demonstrations organised bySurfers Against Sewagewere also held on same day on the River Cam in Cambridge, the River Deben in Suffolk, and beaches in Essex. Anglian Water apologised after it recorded nearly 44,000 sewage discharges across the region in 2024 and said it was spending £1bn on overflow and spillage problems. ""This is our playground. We're paddle boarders and swimmers, and we're fed up of it because people have got sick after swimming,"" said Darren, who came up with the idea of ""Pirates against Poo"". ""The water companies put in profit before pollution, which is affecting wildlife and the environment. ""It's not good, and it needs to stop. Is £1bn enough? Is it too little too late? It can't happen tomorrow, it has to happen today,"" he told the BBC. Jacky Honor added: ""They say things are changing, but we need to make sure that's going to happen, so we can't just step back and be quiet. We need to keep our presence out there."" Fellow protester Chris Williams said he had noticed ""pollution incidents"" since settling in Norfolk and doing water sports, including in the River Wensum and Bure. ""After a while I understood it was a major problem and we had to do something to get people's attention. ""We're all here in fancy dress, but we're making a stand against the sewage incidents and pollution, and trying to hold these water companies to account. ""Something needs to be done soon,"" he said. Anglian Water said it was spending £11bn overall to improve its performance, and blamed a large number of storm spills in recent years on extreme weather. Elsewhere in Essex, a protest was held at Jubilee Beach in Southend, which Surfers Against Sewage said ""has one of the worst-hit bathing waters"". It said Anglian Water had promised to cut sewage by 75% but in fact, it increased by 30% in 2024. ""All of these reasons, combined with the loss of two Blue Flags in two years, demonstrates to us the environmental degradation, potential risk to public health and the need for massive change,"" the campaign group said. AnAnglian Waterspokesperson said bathing water quality was ""complicated"" and could ""be affected by many different factors"". ""We know our customers will be disappointed to see an increase in our storm overflow data this year. ""This is largely reflective of the extreme weather and persistent flooding we saw across our region in the first part of 2024 which accounted for nearly 50% of our spills. ""We know our assets need to be resilient to changing weather patterns. We also understand the strength of feeling around storm spills, and having apologised, we have promised transformational action – because we know our climate is going to keep changing, so we have to find better ways of dealing with extreme rainfall.

541476,Water firm profits double as it hikes bills,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lnz22w28zo,"The profit of water firm United Utilities doubled last year before it hit customers with a steep rise in bills. The company's pre-tax profits more than doubled to £355m for the year ending 31 March 2025 before a32% hike in bills was introducedto fund £13.7bn in pipe and sewer upgrades. The company has been accused ofillegally pumping raw sewage into Lake Windermerein recent years. United Utilities said it had delivered ""another strong set of results"" and it pointed to the company cutting sewage spills per storm overflow by a quarter last year. The water firm's biggest annual rise came in April this year whenbills surged by an average of £86 for a typical household. More than seven million United Utilities customers living in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cumbria, most of Cheshire and parts of Derbyshire are to see bills rise by an average of 32% over the next five years. The company said it planned to increase its dividend payout to investors by 4.2%. Chief executive Louise Beardmore said: ""We have delivered another strong set of results for customers, communities and the environment in the North West."" United Utilities was recently accused of failing to report more than 100 million litres of untreated sewage that it illegally dumped into Windermere over a three-year period. Ms Beardmore told MPs in February that the firm's record on spills and flooding ""isn't good enough"". She took home a pay packet of £1.4m last year, made up of a base salary valued at £690,000, plus benefits, bonuses and long-term share awards. The UK's privatised water companies have faced growing public outrage over the extent of pollution, rising bills, high dividends and executive pay and bonuses. The results come after a survey revealed households' trust in water companies had fallen to a new low.

218188,Hundreds turn out for paddle out sewage protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c753716r66go,"Hundreds of swimmers, surfers and paddleboarders have taken to the sea in Cornwall and Devon as part of an annual protest against an ""ongoing sewage scandal"". The nationwide Paddle Out Protest, hosted by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS), took place across 42 bathing sites across the UK on Saturday, including Gylly Beach in Falmouth, as well as Porthmeor and Seaton in Cornwall; and Exmouth, Croyde and Plymouth Hoe in Devon. The charity said water users in the south-west of England were paddling out ""against South West Water's shocking record of sewage pollution"". South West Water said its focus had been to reduce spills at beaches in the bathing season by 20% in the last five years. SAS CEO Giles Bristow, who attended the protest in Falmouth, said the organisation was holding water companies to account. He said: ""We want this ocean to be clean, we want to be able to swim and surf in places like this and just enjoy it without the risk of getting sick; and we want to stop this destruction of our beautiful and precious environment. ""We want people to enjoy it, we want people to go in informed and make sure they're safe, but, ultimately, we've got to clean up these, quite frankly, dirty waters. ""Yes, they're telling us they're investing. The question is can we trust them to do this. So we're all here, we're watching and we're holding them to account."" South West Water said it ""fully respected"" the rights of those who wish to protest peacefully. A spokesperson said: ""We were one of only five companies in the industry to reduce spills compared to 2023. ""Our focus has been to reduce spills at beaches in the bathing season by 20% in the last five years as we continue to focus on what our customers care about. ""We have also been focused on the highest-spilling sites from 2023 and have already removed three-quarters of the top 20 sites. ""There's more to do and we're committed to delivering real change for our customers as we spend record amounts to reduce our use of storm overflows.""

The £11 million project carried out by Wessex Water at Langport over the past 18 months is meant to improve the water quality of the River Parrett and other Somerset waterways. Project manager Victoria Plummer said: ""Chemicals like phosphorus can cause large growths of algae in waterways, damaging plants and animals in those areas by depleting the amount of oxygen in the water."" In the last few years, more than £40 million of similar work to improve treatment methods has been completed or got started across Somerset. This includes work on sites near Martock, Crewkerne and Merriott, all close to the River Parrett. In nearby Somerton, more than £5 million was spent to remove chemicals and enhance the water recycling centre to protect the nearby River Cary. Further north, a £5 million Wessex Water project to build an integrated constructed wetland to naturally remove nutrients is expected to get under way near Shapwick next summer. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Ofwat's final determination of Wessex Water's 2025-30 business plan, which has outlined further action to tackle nutrients in the region's waterways.

101289,At least 25 dead after tornadoes sweep through US Midwest,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nw7v5ykyo,"At least 25 people are reported to have died and dozens are injured after tornadoes tore through parts of two US states. Officials in Kentucky said there had been 18 deaths while seven people were killed in Missouri, including five in the city of St Louis. The Kentucky tornado struck Laurel County in the south-east of the state in the early hours of Saturday. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise. Missouri officials said 5,000 buildings had been damaged, roofs destroyed and power lines downed due to the tornado. About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power as of Saturday afternoon. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said in an update on Saturday that at least 38 people were reported injured in her area, largely from collapsed buildings and toppled trees. Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. ""The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,"" said Laurel County Sheriff John Root in a post on social media. National Weather Service radar suggested the tornado touched down in Missouri shortly after 14:30 local time in the west of the city close to Forest Park - home to St Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 Olympic Games. St Louis Fire Department said three people had to be rescued after part of the nearby Centennial Christian Church collapsed. One of those people died. A curfew was imposed from 21:00 to 06:00 local time in the two areas where most of the damage took place, to prevent injuries from debris and reduce the potential for looting. St Louis mayor Spencer said: ""The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous. ""We're going to have a lot of work to do in the coming days. There is no doubt there, but tonight we are focused on saving lives and keeping people safe and allowing our community to grieve."" The US National Weather Service said tornadoes also hit neighbouring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast. On Saturday, it warned of few tornadoes that could hit northern Texas over the weekend as a result of strong to severe storms in the area. The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as ""Tornado Alley"", where tornadoes are most frequent. They typically occur in the months of May and June, though they could strike during other times of the year. Kentucky has seen an average of five tornadoes each May since the year 2000, while Missouri has seen an average of 16. Are you in the area?Please get in touchbut only if it is safe to do so.

729209,Work exposes timber floor 'stood on by Shakespeare',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7l9lqnyzo,"A theatre where William Shakespeare is thought to have performed has had an area of historic timber floor ""larger than a tennis court"" exposed. The flooring, believed to have been once trodden on by the playwright and actor, was discovered at St George's Guildhall in King's Lynn, Norfolk, in 2023. A conservation project has worked on exposing the wooden floorboards and other areas of the venue. Tim FitzHigham, creative director of the theatre, said: ""The information that's coming out of that floor is kind of like the dry equivalent of theMary Rose; that's how important this discovery is."" The theatre's first recorded performances took place in 1445, long beforeShakespeare's birthin 1564. During 1592-1593 London's theatres were closed because of an outbreak of plague and Shakespeare and his company of actors were on tour in King's Lynn. Thetheatre claims documents showThe Bard acted there in 1592 or 1593. Last yeara doorway, that may once have led to the Bard's dressing room, was also discovered at the King Street venue. Performances were moved to another building on-site in February to start lifting layers of the floor. Mr FitzHigham said the area of floor was ""larger than a tennis court and it's all 1419 beams all around you"". ""Having the whole floor exposed gives us a massive amount of information about the use of the venue over the last 600 years,"" he added. During the conservation project, there has been early evidence of playgoers eating food, drinking, and smoking at the venue. ""We've literally found the food. We found all this stuff down the cracks of the floorboards,"" Mr FitzHigham said. ""We've got loads of nutshells, oyster shells, bits of pipe, broken wine bottles and chicken bones.""

Ben Boxer, 26, has been walking and paddle-boarding over 1,500km (932 miles), including hiking home from work in London, to raise funds for the Marine Conservation Society. The corporate sustainability consultant, from Brighton, is now continuing his mission with a 750kg beach cleaning target, having been inspired by his travels to Canada. Mr Boxer said: ""Starting to weigh what I have been picking up has been eye-opening. I have been picking up a lot of plastic fishing lines. ""The UK could be a lot like Canada if we restored some of the wildlife. I hope to see some of that when I go out in the summer."" Mr Boxer, who last year cycled over 7,500km (4,660 miles) in aid of the Sussex Dolphin Project for whom he volunteers, was inspired to take on the challenge through his long-distance relationship with his then-partner, who lived in Vancouver. His initial cycle challenge was designed to be the length of the flight from London to Vancouver – about 7,500km – and his latest set of events are also inspired by that distance. Mr Boxer says he is completing the challenges in increments and is roughly two- thirds of the way through the fundraiser, Movement for Nature, which he started in January. He said that this included walking back from his job in Paddington in London to Brighton via the Surrey Hills, High Weald and Lewes over the space of a weekend.

""She wasn't someone who cried. She was very matter-of-fact and just got on with things,"" she said A survey by the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution (RABI) in 2021 found that 43% of women in rural areas were classified as either possibly or probably depressed. As part of a three-year study, researchers at the University of Exeter are seeking the views of women in farming to help improve the support provided for their health and wellbeing. Ms Herniman, 52, of South Molton, works as a field insurance advisor and makes it her job to offer support when needed. She said: ""You're invited into the farmhouse kitchen – people tell you about their worries, their fears, the challenges they are suffering. ""If I can prevent what happened to my mum from happening to someone else, I will. ""If I can get them to open up, then I will. That's her legacy."" She added that women were the backbone in farming, and she saw a huge amount of stress and burden put upon them. In 2021, The Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution (RABI) surveyed 15,296 people from across England and Wales (76% male, 23% female) It found: Carly Titmus, 44 works for the young suicide prevention charity, Papyrus. She visits livestock markets in the South West of England to promote awareness. She said: ""I have worked alongside women in our farming communities. ""There is a lot of discussion around isolation and feeling like they are not fitting in and getting time off the farm to have that break away."" Researchers are seeking the views of women in farming to help improve the support provided for their health and wellbeing. The research is led by the University of Exeter and the Farming Community Network (FCN) charity. Leaders said it aimed to better understand the physical and mental health of women working in agriculture - including potential stressors in farming and barriers to seeking support. The survey is part of the three-year research project and team members said they were keen to hear from all women over the age of 18 who were either living and/or working on farms. Researchers said the results would be shared with relevant public health bodies and policy makers. Dr Rebecca Wheeler, from the University of Exeter, who is leading the project, said: ""We want to hear about the experiences of women from across the UK – of all ages and backgrounds – and from different roles in agriculture."" Linda Jones, national manager (FCN Cymru), said: ""This is an important opportunity for women in farming to share their views and contribute to this new research.

1004069,Two new raven chicks arrive at the Tower of London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgww2v204o,"Two five-week-old raven chicks, Henry and Poe, have arrived at their new home in the Tower of London. ""Troublemakers"" Henry and Poe will spend the next few weeks in the enclosure before being introduced to the six other ravens there and eventually encouraged to explore their new residence. Henry is named after all of the Henrys who have lived at the 900-year-old palace and Poe is named after the writer Edgar Allan Poe whose works include the poem The Raven. The Tower usually has six ravens at any time and, according to legend, if they ever leave, it is said that both the fortress and the kingdom will fall. The new arrivals were born in April as part of the Tower of London's raven breeding programme and join Jubilee, Harris, Poppy, Georgie, Edgar and Chaos at the fortress. The group of ravens - known as an unkindness or conspiracy - are cared for by the Ravenmaster Barney Chandler and his team. ""It's an honour to be introducing our new raven chicks Henry and Poe to the Tower of London, and I'm absolutely delighted with how they've settled in so far,"" said Mr Chandler. ""The team and I have had a busy couple of weeks looking after these troublemakers, who require a lot of care and attention when they're very young, but now that they're almost fully fledged we're ready to bring them into the fold and let the other ravens take over showing them the ropes."" The corvids are fed a variety of raw meat each day, an egg once a week and blood-soaked biscuits as a special treat. The Tower of London added that the ravens' important duties included  ""posing for photographs and taste-testing packed lunch items"". According to the Tower of London, the legend states that King Charles II was the first to insist that the ravens of the Tower of London be protected. The story is that the King's astronomer John Flamsteed, who had an observatory in the White Tower, complained that the resident ravens were impeding his work and requested their removal. The king was advised that if the ravens left the Tower of London the kingdom would fall - the myth has been kept alive ever since.

830098,Livestream shut down as remaining chick falls ill,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz70elwpnjxo,"The parents of the final surviving peregrine chick born in a nest on top of Worcester Cathedral have stopped feeding it. Adult birds Peter and Peggy had produced four eggs, with the first hatching on Easter Sunday. However, two chicks died last week, with the fourth failing to hatch. The remaining chick became sick on Thursday, not calling for food and acting lethargically, which the parents noticed and made no attempt to feed - they will not normally feed ill chicks. A post on peregrine falcons in Worcester stated that it had been decided to shut down the livestream. The post said avian flu could be the cause of the bird's sudden sickness as it displayed three to four symptoms. ""No interest was shown when the adult female landed with prey and proceeded to eat it the box. ""This would also explain why the chick stumbled backwards onto the ledge yesterday. ""If by any chance there is a recovery we will restart, but highly unlikely,"" the Facebook post said. The update comes days after the bird wasreported to be doing fitand healthy. ""What tends to happen is, as the chicks get lower in number, one chick will get fed really well,"" Chris Dobbs, a wildlife expert at the cathedral previously said. Progress in the nest has been livestreamed on YouTube, in a repeat of last year when nearly 500,000 people tuned in from across the world. ""A sad end to this year's season but looking for positive results next year,"" the post said. Follow BBC Hereford & Worcester onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

284832,MPs call for year-long delay to farm inheritance tax,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv78q0g3jo,"Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned. Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% – half the usual rate – saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget. In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without ""adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment"". The government said its inheritance tax reforms were ""vital"" and its commitment to farmers was ""steadfast"". Efra's report said the tax reforms ""threaten to affect the most vulnerable"" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek ""appropriate professional advice"". National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay ""doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers"". He said the policy remained ""fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed"". The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall. The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme ""affected trust in the government"" and left many farmers ""at risk of becoming unviable"". When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it asanother ""shattering blow"" to farmers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure. But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that ""a restoration of trust is urgently required"". Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively. ""The government, however, seems to be dismissing farmers' concerns and ignoring the strength of feeling evidenced in the months of protests that saw tractors converge on Westminster and up and down the country,"" he added. The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its ""current disastrous policy"" on inheritance tax. It said the government should consider an alternative ""clawback"" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale. CLA president Victoria Vyvyan said the ""clawback"" proposal would limit the damage to family businesses while targeting ""those who have bought land to shelter wealth for short-term gain"". ""The government has dug itself into a deep hole by targeting family farms and businesses, and must now pause, listen and consult,"" she said. But a government spokesman said that under its changes three quarters of estates would continue to pay no inheritance tax at all, while the remaining quarter would ""pay half the inheritance tax that most people pay"". He added that payments could be spread over 10 years, interest-free. Details of a new SFI scheme will be announced after the upcoming spending review.

990726,Sewage spill couple 'outraged' and out-of-pocket,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xgqvj1p2ro,"A water company has been criticised by a retired couple who said their front garden had been ruined by a sewage spill. The leak happened in Green Lane, Sonning Common, Oxfordshire, as workers tried to clear a blockage in a nearby street caused by a build-up of fat, oil and grease. Thames Water has agreed to remove pea gravel from the home that has been contaminated, as well as any plants, but it will not pay to reinstate the garden. It has left keen gardener Clare Talbot and her husband Malcolm facing a large bill or costly insurance claim. ""I was devastated,"" Mrs Talbot said. ""I've put so much time, energy and love into growing this garden, from scratch, over the last four years and quite a few plants could well be trashed."" Thames Water did jet wash the patio in the back garden following the spill on 28 April but the front garden is covered in pea gravel which the company has a policy of not removing or replacing. After Mrs Talbot complained to the company, it is now planning to clear away contaminated gravel as a ""gesture of goodwill"" but will not reinstate the garden. Mrs Talbot said it would likely cost up to a £1,000 to fix. The couple may be able to claim on their home insurance but they have an excess and worry about their premium rising as a result. ""I'm absolutely outraged, incensed, that a big company like that can just damage someone's private property and walk away,"" she said. ""It's astonishing."" In a statement, Thames Water said: ""We're very sorry that Ms Talbot experienced external sewer flooding at her home, and we recognise just how distressing this can be. ""Due to complexities surrounding the clean up at the front of the property, further discussions were needed. ""A plan has now been put in place on how best to approach this work."" Mrs Talbot said: ""It's been extremely upsetting. ""We can't go elsewhere for our water and they can do as they please. ""They have us over a barrel. They should be reimbursing us.

Sampling will continue until the end of September, with updates available on theSwimfo website, it said. Samples are tested for harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and intestinal enterococci. The agency said Swimfo also included pollution risk forecasting, which warns people on some days water quality could be temporarily reduced due to factors such as rainfall, wind and high tides. Beaches are classed as excellent, good, sufficient and poor. Any classification from sufficient and above means the water is safe to swim in, said the agency. Beaches such as Perranporth in Cornwall received an excellent grading while only two beaches in Devon and Cornwall, Coastguards Beach on the Erme Estuary and Porthluney, were classed as poor. A poor classification means ""very high standards are not consistently met"", said the agency, which would be ""actively investigating why"".

486629,Food waste collections coming to Brighton and Hove,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqeln7q7wxo,"Brighton & Hove City Council has approved food waste collections in the city. The new scheme, funded by the government and £1.2m from the local authority's budget, is set to be rolled out in stages from September. BHCC said the scheme would help boost recycling rates – which are ""historically low"" in the city - by getting food waste out of general refuse. Some residents raised concerns that food waste collections could lead to additional smells and traffic. Councillor Tim Rowkins, cabinet member for net zero and environmental services, said at a council meeting on Thursday the waste would be stored in sealed containers and removed in 24 hours. He added it would mean less smell and fewer vehicles. About a third of household rubbish in Brighton and Hove is food and drink waste, approximately 2.8kg per household each week, according to the council. BHCC said the food waste would be turned into compost for use in and around the city. Food waste collections are set to be extended to all households by March 2026. Kerbside collections will be made weekly, while communal food waste would be collected every day under the proposals.

886415,Plans to build lithium battery facility rejected,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7ey1qr5jo,"Plans to build a lithium battery storage facility in East Devon have been rejected. Clearstone Energy had asked for permission to build and operate the battery energy storage system (BESS) south of Hazelhurst Raymonds Hill in Axminster. However, planners at East Devon District Council rejected the scheme after a three-and-a-half hour debate which saw residents raise concerns about fire risks and pollution. Despite the developer stating its equipment was 100% safe, examples of BESS fires around the country were highlighted as evidence about why the scheme should be refused. BESS facilities allow energy companies to store electricity generated by renewable sources, such as wind or solar. The Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid this meant they could provide locations with renewably-generated energy, even when supply from those sources was low because of lack of sunshine or wind. Simon Rothwell, from Clearstone Energy, said proposals such as this one were ""critical"" to increasing energy security, reducing energy costs and slowing the rate of climate change. He said the project would not have ""put the safety of local residents or the water supplies at risk"". Elliot Jones, speaking on behalf of Hawkchurch Action Group, said the application being considered raised ""profound risks to public safety and environmental integrity"". Councillor Sarah Jackson said she had worked at a company that developed products to contain lithium iron battery fires. She said they were ""toxic"" and ""hard to extinguish"". Councillor Paul Hayward said he understood the need for green energy solutions, but felt the application contradicted many of the council's planning policies. He said: ""With power comes responsibility, and so anyone proposing this type of scheme in open countryside needs to provide you with 100% assurance that the benefits outweigh the risk of harm.

639783,Claims Red Arrows face solar glare risk rejected,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c706kjz3l28o,"An RAF source has dismissed claims that glare from solar farms could cause the Red Arrows to crash. In a House of Commons debate, Conservative MP Dr Caroline Johnson said light reflecting from panels could dazzle RAF pilots flying from air bases, including one  used for training aircrew. However, a senior RAF source told the PA news agency this was not the case and ""in general terms, solar panels across fields in Lincolnshire are not going to affect our pilots"". The Ministry of Defence and the RAF have been contacted for comment. Johnson, the MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, hit out at plans for large solar farms in her rural Lincolnshire constituency during a parliamentary debate on the issue, arguing they were inappropriate as they could hinder farmland productivity. She told the Commons earlier: ""I also ask the minister to give due consideration to the three RAF bases local to my constituency, RAF Waddington, RAF Cranwell and RAF Digby. ""Glint and glare from reflective panels will cause problems for pilots flying over these areas. ""Our newest pilots undergo basic training at Cranwell and RAF Waddington is home to the Red Arrows."" She said while it was ""a huge joy"" to watch the display team practising at high speeds, clusters of adjoining panels ""creating glint and glare could lead to disaster"". Labour MP Sarah Russell intervened to point out the pilots in countries such as Spain, where there are ""widespread solar panels"", did not have a problem. Johnson replied: ""I wonder if the average jumbo jet flying to Heathrow does a loop-the-loop on the way in?"" A senior RAF source, who had flown fast jets for more than two decades, said: ""At no point in my flying career did I ever have any problems with solar panels. Clearly, they weren't as prolific as they are now around the UK, but even so. ""If you were putting something big, shiny and tall on the approach lane to a major airfield like Heathrow or any of our MoD operating bases, then clearly the Ministry of Defence or the Civil Aviation Authority would be interested and put a request in for more information, and if we weren't happy, we would oppose it."" Energy minister Michael Shanks said: ""These solar panels are designed to absorb light, not reflect it... glint and glare is considered within the planning process already."" Five large solar farms have already been approved for Lincolnshire, with more already in the pipeline. Johnson said: ""Lincolnshire is the nation's bread basket and produces 30% of the nation's vegetables. ""This is land we can least afford to lose.""

1045969,Retired couple 'devastated' by solar farm plans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5w17vrv2o,"A couple said plans that would leave their rural retirement cottage ""surrounded by 15ft (4.5m) solar panels"" were ""devastating"". Mandy Goodhand and Stevie Johnson-Mansley bought their cottage in rural Lincolnshire in 2020 to renovate and retire to. However,  three years later they received a ""knock on the door"" from a local farmer to inform them the surrounding fields were being leased to make way for solar panels. The couple's MP Dr Caroline Johnson, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, has secured a debate on the impact of large scale solar farms in the House of Commons later. ""I will be putting forwards the concerns both I and my constituents share about large-scale solar farms and their impact on agricultural land and our local area,"" she said. Five large solar farms have already been approved for Lincolnshire. These include theMallard Passproject which spans two counties and was strongly opposed by local residents. There are at least nine other solar projects planned in the county, including one near Mandy and Stevie's home in Howell Fen near Heckington. Developer Low Carbon wants to build the solar farm, known as the Beacon Fen Energy Park, which would be capable of powering up to 130,000 homes. The couple said it would lead to their rural smallholding being ""dominated"" by solar panels. Stevie, a retired nurse, said she felt there was little they could do to stop the proposal. ""It does appear that these projects are just being rubber-stamped, to be honest. I don't think local people's views come into it."" Mandy and Stevie welcomed the parliamentary debate on solar energy being led by their local MP. Mandy said: ""The bigger concern, apart from our own, is that land is being taken away - land that would normally be used for food."" Writing on her Facebook page, Johnson outlined the scope of Thursday's debate. ""I will be raising the cumulative effects of these proposals, the threat to our food security, the human impact on the villages the panels will surround and modern slavery concerns surrounding the production of solar panel components."" Low Carbon said it had ""engaged with many local residents""  to mitigate some of the impacts of its proposals and ""better understand their concerns"". A spokesperson said ""the land take involved for solar developments is minimal in the context of food production"" and said the solar industry was playing ""an important role in keeping farms viable"". Large solar farms are classed asNationally Significant Infrastructure Projects(NSIPS) which means they are ultimately decided on by government ministers rather than local councils. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Net Zero said the amount of farmland being used by solar projects should not be a concern. ""As of September last year, solar farms covered around 0.1% of the total land area of the UK,"" they said. The spokesperson added: ""Projects are subject to a rigorous planning process in which the views and interests of the local community and impacts on the local environment, including any impact on amenities, landscapes and land use, are considered.""

161632,Author wins inaugural climate fiction prize,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czelpy1l1exo,"The winner of the first ever Climate Fiction Prize has been announced as Nigerian author, Abi Daré. The University of Wolverhampton law graduate has been awarded the inaugural prize for her novel, And So I Roar, a sequel to her bestselling debut, The Girl with the Louding Voice. And So I Roar delves into the lives of rural women and girls in Nigeria, whose lives are impacted by environmental collapse. Daré, who lives in Benfleet, Essex, said: ""As a Black British-Nigerian woman, receiving this prize is a reminder that we do not need to wait for permission to step into global conversations or to contort our stories to fit a certain lens."" The author won the prestigious £10,000 prize at a ceremony in London on Wednesday evening. Author and judging chair Madeleine Bunting described the novel as: ""A book of real energy and passion, which both horrifies and entertains with a cast of compelling characters, a story of how the climate crisis can provoke social crisis where often women and children are the victims. ""Despite the tragedy, Abi Daré holds faith in the strength of individuals and relationships, and her hopefulness leaves us inspired."" The Climate Prize strives to celebrate the most inspiring novels tackling the climate crisis. On its official website, a spokesperson for the prize said: ""We want to reward and showcase powerful stories that depict the human response to climate change, how it impacts us and how society responds. ""For societies to fully grasp the climate change threat and to embrace its solutions, we need better stories. It's not enough for audiences to know about climate change, they need to see an uncertain future and understand that change is urgent but possible. ""Many of us already see tackling climate as important, but we don't always know how we should respond. Fiction can help us imagine what change can look like."" And So I Roar was one of five books to be shortlisted alongside The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley, Briefly Very Beautiful by Roz Dineen, The Morningside by Téa Obreht and Orbital by Samantha Harvey - whichwon the 2024 Booker Prize. Speaking of Daré's win, David Wedge, the University of Wolverhampton's head of alumni relations, said: ""We are incredibly proud of Abi for winning this groundbreaking award.

835159,Island volunteers 'save 45 years of bat research',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2emrxrjv1o,"A survey of Bailiwick bat species would have taken more than 45 years to complete without the help of hundreds of local volunteers, according to the States. The now completed Bailiwick Bat Surveywas a volunteer-led initiative organised by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), the States of Guernsey and Bailiwick La Sociétés and wildlife trusts. Between 2021 and 2024, 420 volunteers collected more than 16 million bat sound recordings, which included six bat species never previously recorded in the Bailiwick. Julia Henney, the States' senior natural environment officer, said the survey would have taken one researcher decades to complete and would have cost up to £2m. Volunteers who signed up to the survey were able to borrow sound recording equipment, which was installed in areas across the Bailiwick for up to seven nights. The recordings were uploaded to theBTO's Acoustic Pipelinefor analysis, providing initial results within hours. ""This survey has changed and broadened our understanding of bats across the Bailiwick of Guernsey,"" said Ms Henney. ""This has all been possible thanks to keen volunteers getting stuck in, increasing community awareness of nature, as intended through Guernsey's Strategy for Nature."" She added: ""It would've taken one researcher over 45 years to gather this amount of data, potentially costing up to £2m, which serves to highlight the value of our community's efforts in gathering this insightful data."" Volunteers conducted 9,426 nights of recording at 2,364 locations, collecting more than 16 million triggered sound recordings. Four million bat identifications were confirmed, including the presence of 14 bat species, six of which were never previously recorded in the Bailiwick. Four of the six newly recorded species, serotine, Leisler's bat, common noctule and parti-coloured bat, are rare visitors to the islands. While the lesser horseshoe bat and whiskered or Brandt's bat appeared to be rare residents,according to the survey results. The study also found that underground tunnels from the Nazi German occupation were important roosting and hibernation sites for several of the rarer species of bats. BTO and the States of Guernsey worked in partnership with La Société Guernesiaise, Alderney WIldlife Trust and La Société Sercquaise on the project.

576141,How dangerous dust is putting farm workers' lives at risk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071g2mxl9yo,"The risks of working with animals and machinery on farms are well known, but agricultural workers are being reminded of another danger that is part of their everyday work. The Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) have teamed up with other agencies to spread awareness of the dangerous of dust particles which can lead to scarring on the lungs atthis year's Balmoral Show. Johnny Tuft, a fourth generation farmer from Ballinderry in County Antrim, described being unable to stop coughing whilst in bed at night. Previously, Mr Tuft said he would convince himself he would be ""wasting"" a doctor's time but now said he will take lung health more seriously in future. More than 300 people a year die from work-related illnesses in Northern Ireland, according to HSENI. Johnny Tuft farms a mixed farm with beef cattle, sheep, arable and poultry units and is often exposed to dust particles. ""We need to bed our livestock whether it be cattle or poultry and there's dust in the bedding,"" he said. ""We grow arable and we feed livestock with our own barley and through the whole cultivation process there's dust. ""When you're in the tractor there's dust, whenever we roll barley that creates a lot of dust and then feeding it too."" Wearing a mask would help reduce exposure but Mr Tuft said he often did not have time to protect himself. ""There's times where the mask isn't beside you or you're under time pressure and it's just too easy to go and do the job without PPE [personal protective equipment],"" he said. ""Then maybe that night you're lying in bed and you can't stop coughing"". Bryan Monson, the deputy chief executive of HSENI, is using the Balmoral Show to help spread the message of lung health to farmers. ""There's nothing like coming to Balmoral to meet people face to face and we can give them some really useful advice, along with our other partners, about how they look after themselves,"" he said. Recent research carried out for the organisation showed how risky farming could be for respiratory health. ""For farmers unfortunately they're exposed to an awful lot of different dusts and chemicals and gases, and those can affect and damage people's lungs, and it's maybe not that well known or understood,"" Mr Monson said. ""So this year, what we're hoping to do is raise awareness of lung health and some of the simple things that people can do to protect themselves."" He said reducing exposure to dust was really important. ""People will immediately think 'I'm putting on a dust mask', and that can be part of the solution,"" he said. ""But as well as that, working in well ventilated areas, working upwind of dusty activities, wetting down dusts before they're brushed or moved around, and possibly buying pelleted forms of feeds and chemicals rather than loose forms. ""All of these can reduce your dust exposure."" Dr Sean Roe, a senior lecturer at Queens University Belfast's medical school, said farmers often dismissed the initial signs of a respiratory issues, which include sniffing, coughing or watery eyes. He said it was better to try to prevent a respiratory issue rather than try to cure it. ""to be working from the point of view of prevention rather than cure"". ""Prevention is really the best way of dealing with it because in the long term, once you start to do permanent damage to the lungs, it's very hard to treat it,"" Dr Roe said. ""If you take in that dust and it stays down it can produce scar tissue in the lungs. ""The problem with scar tissue is - if you've ever had a scar on the back of your hand - you'll notice that the scar tissue isn't as flexible as the skin and it's similar in the lungs that over a long period of time, it leads to what's known as pulmonary fibrosis. ""Pulmonary fibrosis is a situation where the lungs become smaller and stiffer and less elastic and harder to inflate, and that can give rise to one of the problems which is known as chronic farmer's lungs."" Mr Tuft said he would now think more about his respiratory health when he is working. ""I think now that I'm starting to know people that have had health issues, long health issues from farms maybe I need to start taking it a bit more seriously,"" he said. ""I would tend not to go to the doctor unless I'm in pain. I would nearly convince myself I am wasting the doctor's time if it's just a cough, that I'll be fine in the morning. ""But maybe I should be more concerned."" It said new buyers Regeneron had committed to protect user data as part of the deal.

384134,Ed Miliband criticises Reform's Net Zero stance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gew0nj285o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband criticised Reform UK's stance on Net Zero as he defended his decision to approve a large solar farm in East Yorkshire. A proposal to build a 3,155 acre (1,277 hectares) site near Howden, despite objections by locals, was given the go-ahead last week. Reform, which recently took control of Lincolnshire County Council as well as winning mayoral elections in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, has campaigned on abandoning the government's target to reach Net Zero by 2050. Miliband said Reform's view was ""wrong"" and added: ""We're going to have a debate with them about it."" Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice, who is the MP for Boston and Skegness, hasdescribed renewable energy as a ""massive con""that raised energy bills and pledged his party would introduce a windfall tax on green energy companies. Miliband added: ""I think people vote in elections for all kinds of reasons, but I'm going to make the case, as will local MPs, for why renewables are about lower bills and they're about good jobs. ""Just a few miles from here we've got the Siemens factory - 1600 people manufacturing wind turbines. What I'd say to those people who've been elected is don't turn your back on those jobs. Don't turn your back on lower bills."" The Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero was visiting the site of a solar farm in Cottingham that provides electricity to Castle Hill Hospital, five days after approving the site in Howden. He said he understood why people have concerns about solar farms and took those on board when making the decision to give it the go-ahead. ""Whenever decisions like that are made, we listen to local people's views,"" he said. ""But we have to make also wider decisions about how we're going to get clean, homegrown power that we control so we can cut people's bills and we know what happens when we're left reliant on fossil fuels."" One local protest group said there was""severe disappointment""that the site was approved. Its developers said it would produce 400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 100,000 homes. Due to its size, the decision to go ahead was made by Miliband as it is classed as national infrastructure. It is one of a number oflarge solar developmentsplanned for East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. He told BBC Look North: ""Every solar panel we put up, every wind turbine we build, every piece of infrastructure we build helps get us off those fossil fuels and give us energy security.""

North Pennines National Landscape (NPNL) said the three-year project involved working with about 120 landowners to identify 761 acres (308 hectares) as suitable for trees. The project focused on small woodlands and low-density wood pasture, with scrub and scattered canopy trees to work alongside farming systems, NPNL said. NPNL said the North Pennines was ""one of the least wooded areas of England"" and the initiative looked to ""bridge the gap"" between the existing Great Northumberland National Forest and the Northern Forest. The North Pennines covers much of the west of County Durham together with parts of Northumberland and Cumbria,according to Durham Landscapes. The NPNL said it worked with 37 landowners to secure funding for tree planting spanning 128 acres (52 hectares). NPNL advised the landowners to plant different species of native trees, including aspen, wild cherry and crab apple, and shrub such as blackthorn. The group said it also identified areas where tree planting would have the least negative effect on wading bird populations, which rely on open landscapes. NPNL's Sarah Tooze said: ""The project focused on the kinds of tree cover - small scale woodlands and low-density wood pasture with scrub and scattered canopy trees - which work alongside nature friendly farming systems and will improve the landscape for biodiversity and other public goods.""

840624,How an orphaned lamb changed estate agent's life,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4kp23718po,"Flashy cars, a prestige job and plenty of money - high-flying estate agent Stephen Keighley had it all. Underneath, he knew ""something was badly wrong"". ""One morning I was driving to work, and tears started coming down my face,"" he said. ""I pulled over, rang into work and said, 'I'm not coming in' and they said, 'will you be back tomorrow' and I said, 'No I'm never coming back' and that was it."" Mr Keighley left his London life of 25 years and moved back to Cornwall, where he had grown up. Despite being back home, he still struggled. That was until five years ago when a friend gave him an orphaned lamb named Benny to care for - giving him a purpose that ""changed his life"". ""Having to care for Benny 24/7 and help him survive gave me a motivation and a purpose in life that perhaps I had been missing for a few years,"" Mr Keighley explained. ""My mental health wasn't in the greatest place in the world and perhaps Benny came along at the right time for me."" Mr Keighley, who grew up in Launceston, then bought two more sheep to keep Benny company and soon realised  he had found his calling - to be a shepherd. He now has a flock of 38 rare breed sheep having swapped his office for fields near Vixen Tor on Dartmoor, in Devon. ""It's a complete and utter contrast from what I was doing and what I did for the majority of my life,"" he said. ""I used to drag myself out of bed when the alarm went off, put on a sharp suit and go to work. ""Now I spend my days in tatty clothes covered in sheep poo, but I no longer need an alarm - as soon as the sun comes up, I can't wait to get out here."" He said he would not change a thing. ""I've learnt a lot from sheep in terms of life experience,"" he said. ""They've taught me how to just 'be'. ""Just to stand back and watch their social interactions, the way they happily spend their days happily grazing and lying around, that taught me life doesn't have to be as fast-paced as mine had been. ""It's given me time to reflect and to work out what's important in life."" As for Benny, he is now a fully grown ram. Mr Keighley, who kept him as a pet, said he was definitely not for sale.

West Mercia Police initially said the swanshad been shot with an air riflein Newport between 30 April and 1 May, but officers later said it appeared the birds had beenkilled by another animal. Councillor Thomas Janke, who chairs Newport Town Council's community safety committee, said a wave of unfounded rumours had appeared online, some casting doubt on the integrity of the police neighbourhood team.

1039510,MPs call for year-long delay to farm inheritance tax,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv78q0g3jo#comments,"Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned. Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% – half the usual rate – saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget. In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without ""adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment"". The government said its inheritance tax reforms were ""vital"" and its commitment to farmers was ""steadfast"". Efra's report said the tax reforms ""threaten to affect the most vulnerable"" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek ""appropriate professional advice"". National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay ""doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers"". He said the policy remained ""fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed"". The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall. The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme ""affected trust in the government"" and left many farmers ""at risk of becoming unviable"". When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it asanother ""shattering blow"" to farmers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure. But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that ""a restoration of trust is urgently required"". Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively. ""The government, however, seems to be dismissing farmers' concerns and ignoring the strength of feeling evidenced in the months of protests that saw tractors converge on Westminster and up and down the country,"" he added. The CLA, which represents 28,000 farmers and rural businesses, urged the government to rethink its ""current disastrous policy"" on inheritance tax. It said the government should consider an alternative ""clawback"" scheme, under which 100% agricultural and business property reliefs would remain but inheritance tax would be applied to assets if sold within a certain period of time post-death, payable out of the proceeds of the sale. CLA president Victoria Vyvyan said the ""clawback"" proposal would limit the damage to family businesses while targeting ""those who have bought land to shelter wealth for short-term gain"". ""The government has dug itself into a deep hole by targeting family farms and businesses, and must now pause, listen and consult,"" she said. But a government spokesman said that under its changes three quarters of estates would continue to pay no inheritance tax at all, while the remaining quarter would ""pay half the inheritance tax that most people pay"". He added that payments could be spread over 10 years, interest-free. Details of a new SFI scheme will be announced after the upcoming spending review.

291706,"Foot-and-mouth outbreak 'when, not if' - port boss",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0dr5lk2eno,"A councillor responsible for health at the Port of Dover has warned the return of foot-and-mouth disease to the UK is inevitable, unless government funding improves. Jamie Pout, of Dover District Council, said the health authority was ""barely scratching the surface"" when it came to suitable checks at the Kent port. He added it was ""a matter of time"" until foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever arrived in the country. The port has been approached for comment, while the government said it would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect British farmers from disease. The government added that it had significantly increased seizures of illegal meat products, restricted animal products from EU countries with outbreaks, and banned personal meat and dairy imports for EU travellers. It said it was also investing more than £200m in a new National Biosecurity Centre. It comes after recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly infectious virus that causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. It poses no risk to humans and there are currently no cases in the UK. Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could potentially be contaminated. Labour MP Josh Newbury, who sits on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA), said last week that he saw health inspections at the port being done under ""rusty canopies, with nesting pigeons [in buildings] that had no walls"". Facilities had ""no ability to wash down"" and lacked personal protection equipment other than gloves, he added. Roy Glover, a third-generation livestock farmer and butcher from Hartley Bottom Farm, near Dartford, called the UK's last foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001 ""devastating"" for local farmers. He said it put ""stress"" on his family farm and business. ""It was terrible. I remember being unable to sleep worrying that our farm could be next,"" he said. ""You'd see other farms go down, and you'd spend your time thinking that it could be you next."" Mr Glover urged the government to take foot-and-mouth disease seriously. ""More needs to be done.

282,Why does Scotland use more water than the rest of the UK?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q0j07l9dxo,"People in Scotland have been told touse water supplies sparinglyafter the driest start to the year since 1964. But supplier Scottish Water is also warning that the country's relationship with water is unsustainable in the long run. This is because the average person in Scotland uses about 40% more water than the average person in Yorkshire. So why does Scotland use more water than the rest of the UK? Scotland has some of the wettest parts of the UK, so it is perhaps counterintuitive to think about it as a country facing water scarcity. One challenge is the fact that only around 1% of the country's infamous rainfall is captured in reservoirs. Another supply issue is that Scotland gets through so much water compared to the rest of the UK. Figures from regulator Ofwatshow that in 2023/24 an average of 140.4 litres of water per person per day was used in England and Wales. Yorkshire Water's rate in this period was 126.9 litres per day, while Northumbrian Water was 154.7 litres per day. By contrast, Scottish Water's consumption rate was an average of 178 litres per day. The way Scots pay for water offers one possible explanation for the bigger consumption rates. About half of households in England and Wales have a water meter, so they only pay for the amount they use, plus a standing charge. Only a small number of Scottish households have water meters. Instead, most pay for water and sewerage services as part of their council tax, with the amount linked to their property's council tax band. This means that for many in Scotland the only time they see how much they pay for water is when they see the annual council tax statement. Research has shown that households with meters use less water as they are more aware of how much their usage is costing them.  A fact rolled out on most school trips to Loch Ness is that it contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined. In a country with 30,000 freshwater lochs, water scarcity is not usually high on the agenda. But it is this perception of abundance that troubles Scottish Water's chief executive Alex Plant. Speaking to theBBC podcast ScotCast in February, he said: ""We're at a point where we are really worried, collectively as a nation, about the sufficiency of our water supply. ""So we should be thinking about water not as plentiful and abundant and you don't need to worry about it, and more as something that is a precious resource. ""Part of it is this mindset that we assume it's abundant and therefore we don't worry about it too much."" He added: ""I think another reason is that almost nobody in Scotland understands how much water they're using because we pay through our council tax (and) we don't understand the amount we're using."" Scotland is also facing more frequent spells without rain. Climate change models predict that summers in Scotland will likely become drier, with a potential decrease of 10% to 20% in summer rainfall. An opinion polling by Consumer Scotlandsuggests most consumers (77%) in Scotland are concerned about climate change. However, only around one in five (19%) are concerned about how much water is used in their home. Creating a better understanding of the link between the impact of climate change and water usage is what Mr Plant wants to address. Although households are the biggest users of water in Scotland, its industrial uses are also a factor in the overall consumption rates. Water - both rainfall and surface water - is critical to the production of the country's most famous export, whisky. This is why distilleries are paying close attention to projections that suggest there will bedouble the frequency of low river flow events by 2050. Elsewhere, water from rivers and burns is also vital to Scotland's agricultural sector. Soft fruit and vegetable production, mainly based in the south and east of the country, often requires large volumes of water to irrigate crops. This is especially true in dry periods like the current one. Heavy industry like chemical plants are also big consumers of water, with the Grangemouth industrial complex historically one of the biggest daily users of mains water in the UK. Part of Scottish Water's plan to try and get Scotland's consumption rates closer to English rates is to get people thinking about the water they use. The utility firm is embarking on a pilot project in Dundee to install ""smart"" monitors for around 2,000 homes over a three-year period. It is hoped this will help customers understand their water usage and improve Scottish Water's ability to find and fix leaks. Mr Plant said: ""It's a monitor rather than a meter because you're not going to pay for it. ""We'd be able to start showing people what they're using, not to charge by the usage, but just to show people what they are using. ""Understanding what you're using encourages a different relationship with the thing you're using."" Anglian Water is replacing its current facility near Milton with a new plant close to Horningsea.

Arable farmer Nigel Friend raises animals and grows crops at Cranborne Chase in Dorset, he said unless the weather improved in the next ten days, there could be grain shortages. Mr Friend told BBC Radio Solent presenter Steve Harris he had been farming all his life and this year, farmers needed ""significant amounts of rainfall"". ""Crops are suffering, the increased heat is causing problems for animals as well, with things like fly strike on sheep being very early this year and obviously we're preserving our foraged stocks for the winter ahead, because we don't have any grass,"" he explained. Mr Friend said farmers across the UK had ""suffered two horrendously wet years"", which had damaged the soil, but after the recent dry weather he was now finding cracks on his farm at least 10in (25.4cm) deep. George Brown, who grows porridge oats, spring barley and white clover on Priors Farm in Peasemore near Newbury, shares Mr Friend's concerns. He said: ""You've got to remind yourself you've been very lucky to have the sun at your back, but really I've been praying for rain for the last six weeks. ""We wanted some rain to get the crops growing out of the ground, but it just hasn't turned up."" Elsewhere in Basingstoke, Hampshire, Ian Constable said he had been forced to adapt the way his farm was feeding its animals. Mr Constable, who Street Croft Farm in Herriard, explained: ""Obviously no rain, so no grass growth. ""We've got a few hundred lambs and ewes running around and there's not a lot for them to eat. ""All the grass just hasn't taken off this year, which means we're supplementary feeding everything, buying in a lot of feed to keep them fed and healthy."" Alan Hutton, chair of Hampshire's National Farmers' Union, added: ""Farming is an extraordinarily risky occupation. ""I want to reassure the public there is not going to be a food shortage this year, but please if you're coming to the countryside, treat it with respect. ""It is going to be very, very dry this summer, so please don't go smoking and throwing cigarettes out the window and that sort of thing – it is your food supply after all."" Mr Friend is expecting dry weather for another 10 weeks based on long-range forecasting, but said the next 10 days would be ""crucial"" for farmers. ""Normally by now you would expect wheat to be knee high, at the moment it's halfway between your ankle and your knee. ""The weather over the next 10 days will make the difference between us having reasonable crop to harvest and a disastrous crop due to the lack of moisture."" Mr Friend's concerns come after the Environment Agencywarned there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought. The Met Office told BBC Weather the UK had experienced an average rainfall accumulation of 80mm so far this spring, compared to an average of 229mm, making it the driest spring on record.

754044,How firms are coping one year after water parasite,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk20en0m3zo,"People in the south Devon fishing town of Brixham remember 15 May 2024 for all the wrong reasons. That was date the UK Health Security Agency confirmed the parasitecryptosporidium was present in tap water in the area, with South West Water (SWW) confirming the contamination of the water supply in the town the next day. A boil notice was issued for thousands of properties, with bottled water handed to stricken residents. More than100 confirmed cases of the diarrhoea-type illnesswere ultimately linked to the Brixham outbreak. The ripple effects of the outbreak continue but some firms in the town said there was hope. Josy Byrne, Post Office manager at nearby Kingswear, fell ill from the cryptosporidium bug on 10 May. ""I've never been so sick in my entire life,"" she said. ""I lost 15lb (6.8kg) in three days and was sick for the whole summer."" She said she continued to suffer from irritable bowel syndrome as a result of the infection. The outbreak had a significant impact on local tourism, with holiday homes remaining empty as visitors cancelled their plans, she said. ""It did hurt the businesses in the area because nobody wanted to come anymore,"" she said. In November 2024 SWWpledged £1.2m to help boost tourismand repair what business leaders described as ""reputational damage"" following the outbreak. Carolyn Custerson, chief executive of the English Riviera BID Company, which aims to increase business in the area, said the strategy to reflect Brixham and the English Riviera in a positive light appeared to be having an impact, with an ""increase in family booking numbers"" over Easter. SWW had ""given us the support that has enabled us to run campaigns aimed at encouraging people to come to Brixham and the surrounding Torbay area this summer,"" she said. ""We are looking forward to welcoming past and new visitors to our beautiful region."" Andrew Stockman, who runs a picture gallery and amusement arcade in Brixham, said business had been rocked by the outbreak. ""We have seen a lot of regulars who were put off for a year find somewhere else,"" he said. ""It's been really significant, the streets are quieter and it will probably be two or three years before it recovers. ""These things really do affect small towns like ours."" SWW had offered him £500 compensation for both businesses, a fraction of what he reckoned he lost. The ""older crowd"" that were regular visitors had also been put off by higher costs of living, he said. John Ingram, owner of the Bay Coffee Company, said the outbreak turned Brixham into a ""ghost town"". ""It had a really devastating effect for about nine to 12 weeks,"" he said, adding the ripple effects continued throughout the year with slower bookings and harder trade. He estimated that his business lost about 25-30% of its revenue during the crisis. Despite the challenges, he said: ""We've got to keep positive and keep working at this."" He said he was confident about the upcoming summer, with several festivals planned. ""Big smiles, great sunshine. Come and visit us here in Devon,"" he said. SWW said in a statement it was ""sorry for what happened in Brixham last year"". ""While we can't undo what happened, we have made already made improvements to make sure it cannot happen here again,"" it said. ""Our focus is firmly on the future for customers and communities and we are working to support local tourism in the area. ""We are prioritising long-term improvements so that every community we serve can continue to rely on us.""

768559,Captain comes home on the 'biggest' ship around,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj9gl2x8jo,"The captain of a huge ship docked in Hull has described it affectionately as ""the biggest and baddest"" around. Robert Southwell, from the Beverley area, is master of the Wind Peak, a purpose-built vessel that is being used to transport wind turbine components from a Siemens Gamesa plant to the Sofia offshore wind farm in the North Sea. He said he was proud to be back in Hull after spending 20 years at sea. ""We plan to be on this project for the next year and it is certainly nice for me, being local, to come in and out of Hull,"" he added. ""It's the first time I have done it other than [on] the ferry."" The BBC's Richard Stead was shown around the vessel, which is 162m (530ft) long and 60m (196ft) wide. It was built for Cadeler, a Danish firm that installs offshore wind farms, and left a shipyard in China last summer beforearriving in Hull in March. The Wind Peak is so large, it can carry enough equipment to build six turbines at a time. Mr Southwell and his crew construct them and then connect them to the grid. They live on the ship for four weeks at a time, before taking four weeks' leave. Mr Southwell admitted he is looking forward to being closer to his wife, 21-month-old son and relatives in East Yorkshire, after being so far away from home at sea. ""I enjoy the fact that many of my friends and relatives can see the vessel from their homes,"" he added of the new local landmark. Mr Southwell said it took about 14 hours for the Wind Peak to reach the Dogger Bank, where the farm is being built. ""It is a fair way out, but there's a lot of activity out of there,"" he added. ""Interestingly for this area, the electricity that's generated by these turbines runs through the substation ashore at Skipsea and then up to Creyke Beck [in Cottingham], and that's where it's plugged into the National Grid.""

The rubbish, floating in Radipole Lake Nature Reserve in Weymouth was cleared by Dorset Council rangers and volunteers from Weymouth & Portland Marine Litter Project CIC. A designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the 83 hectare (205 acre) reserve is home to a range of wildlife including swans, kingfishers, otters and water voles. The council said it was working with several organisations ""to try and make sure litter here is not such an issue... but sadly it does seem to build-up very quickly.""

268786,Power plant bosses concerned as subsidy cuts loom,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861q2gld1xo,"Bosses of a biogas power plant in Warwickshire say they are worried about its future after the government revealed subsidies for the industry are to be axed. Cotesbach Landfill Gas Project, near Rugby, traps methane from rotting organic rubbish in landfill and uses it to generate green energy. David Rice, managing director of Melton CLP - which runs the site - said that when the renewable energy subsidy is withdrawn in 2027, it will force 87% of sites like this plant to ""close overnight"". The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it was exploring options to support the sector meeting net zero targets as well as addressing the interests of bill-payers. ""Electricity produced from landfill gas generators plays an important role in increasing our energy security, while turning off the tap of future methane emissions and helping deliver net zero,"" it added. Melton CLP also runs 18 other sites and said that each year the gas they capture would power about 90,000 homes across the country. ""Not only would you lose the benefit of the renewable energy that comes from them, but also you'd see an increase in methane emissions across the UK,"" said Mr Rice. Paul Cleary, who owns the plant near Rugby, explained that he and his team mine for pockets of methane emitting from the waste. Methane is generated by a number of things, including garden waste, kitchen scraps and nappies. The gas is extracted and used to power large engines that, in turn, generate green electricity. He told the BBC the plant's work was important. ""If we weren't here and you had the waste inside a landfill site, the methane would build in pressure and it would start to smell,"" he said. ""It would obviously create environment issues if no-one was here doing what we do."" Outside the industry, others are also concerned. Liam Hardy, head of research at environmental charity Green Alliance, said the UK was signed up to several treaties promising to reduce methane emissions, and this industry was a vital part of doing that. He told the BBC that if the industry collapsed because of the move by the government, it would be a ""disaster"" for climate change. ""Because it's also really short-lived in the atmosphere, actually tackling methane emissions can have an immediate effect,"" he said. ""We should be thinking of action on methane as the emergency brake on climate change."" Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

382528,Appeal after buzzard killed in North York Moors,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql257yl47go,"A buzzard has been shot and killed in the North York Moors National Park. It is thought the bird of prey was targeted near to Beck Hole Road, Goathland, on 2 May, according to North Yorkshire Police. Its rural task force appealed for any witnesses or anyone who saw people acting suspiciously in the area at the time to contact police. Buzzards and all other birds of prey are legally protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, meaning to intentionally kill or injure one is a criminal offence. Anyone convicted of doing so could be at risk of receiving an unlimited fine or up to six months in jail, the force said. Tom Hind, chief executive officer of the North York Moors National Park Authority, said: ""We are appalled to once again be addressing the suspected illegal killing of a bird of prey in the North York Moors. ""That we are having to repeat this message highlights the ongoing and unacceptable threat posed to wildlife in our region.""

1099253,Farmer's yield concerns after no 'meaningful rain',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgle9pdz8gdo,"Farmers in Kent say they are facing reduced yields at their next harvest due to exceptionally dry weather. The Environment Agencywarned in Maythat, although there was not currently a drought in England, there was a ""medium risk of one this summer"". The UK ison course for its driest spring in over a centuryand April 2025 was the sunniest on record. Andy Barr, an arable farmer in the village of Lenham, said his crops ""haven't had any meaningful rain for three or four weeks now"". Mr Barr said he was concerned that his plants were shorter, paler and already developing ears of grain, which he would not expect to see ""for a couple of weeks"". ""The plant is telling me it's under stress, it can't take up the nutrients it wants, it's thinking, 'I'm going to die soon, I better produce some seeds',"" he said. ""That means less yield for us at the end of the day."" Dry weather has contributed to the area of the UK burnt by wildfires alreadyreaching a higher levelthan the total for any year in more than a decade. On one day in March, Kent Fire & Rescue Service wascalled to three wildfires in one day. Mr Barr said helost crops to fire in 2022. ""The flames were higher than me. It was noisy as you can imagine, and it looked so ferocious I thought we were never going to put it out,"" he said. The farmer is urging members of the public to think carefully about disposing of rubbish. He added: ""The fire brigade thought it could have been something as simple as a bottle discarded months earlier, but because the sun got so intense and everything was so dry, it just caught light and literally set fire to 50 acres of crop."" The dry weather is set to continue in the short term, according to BBC South East weather presenter Nina Ridge. She said: ""The next seven days look as if they're going to be dry, but there are increasing signs that at the end of next week the jet stream will move further south and we'll see low pressure systems bringing us some significant rain for the end of May."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer. That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office. Follow BBC Kent onFacebook, onX, and onInstagram.

The Cotswolds Dogs & Cats Home, near Cambridge in Gloucestershire, is appealing for donations after taking in about 50 cats so far in 2025, at a rate of about three cats per week, including litters of kittens and pregnant females. The charity said basic veterinary treatment for cats has already cost it thousands of pounds in the first half of the year. Sam Herniman, individual giving fundraiser, said: ""With abandonments soaring and rescue centres stretched to capacity, we're concerned about the months ahead."" The RSPCA released figures in November which highlighted a 51% rise in the number of animals being abandoned in England and Wales from 2021. The increase is thought to be due to the cost of living crisis and surge of pet ownership during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Cotswold Dogs & Cats Home said the figures paint a ""stark picture of the deepening animal welfare crisis in the UK"". It said it needs donations to provide food, safety and veterinary care to the neglected animals at its shelter until they find new owners. Among the 48 cats it has taken in already this year, the shelter said it had two litters of kitten and two heavily-pregnant female cats in its care. Ms Herniman said: ""Behind these shocking statistics are the faces of a vulnerable animals, each a precious life in urgent need of care.

606985,All you need to know about the 2025 Balmoral Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvknn422lmo,"The 156th Balmoral Show started on Wednesday at Balmoral Park outside Lisburn. Thousands of people are expected to attend, with four days of sunshine forecast. It is the culmination of months of planning for the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and for the farmers competing with their livestock. Despite being involved in more than 30 shows, the RUAS group operations director Rhonda Geary still gets excited. ""The weather plays a big part in it, but it's always a great event and great to see it all come together after a year of planning,"" she said. ""There's everything, from the livestock classes to sheep shearing, our kids' area with the children's farm, our equestrian areas, our horticulture, our food which is so important, and then we have our shopping halls filled with trade stands."" For farmers like William Irvine, president of the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU),it is a chance to catch up with friendsand show off the fruits of their hard labour in preparing animals for competition. ""Balmoral is a day out, a day to meet folk that we maybe didn't meet since this time last year, it's a day to enjoy, a day to catch up with our friends and colleagues,"" he said. ""It's a shop window for our pedigree breeders, our livestock breeders and all the various sectors within agriculture will be represented at the show."" Inheritance tax was an issue at the forefront of many of those attending the show. From April 2026, a 20% inheritance tax rate will apply to agricultural assets over a £1m threshold. The Treasury believes that, with careful financial planning, about 500 estates a year will be liable to pay the tax, but DAERA says its research showsalmost half of all farms in Northern Ireland will pass the threshold, due to land values alone, with the dairy sector particularly badly hit. First Minister Michelle O'Neill told the Red Lines podcast that although the issue of inheritance tax rests with the Treasury it ""doesn't mean you don't do anything about it"". ""You still continue to fight, it was only a few months ago that we were all here as political parties, standing with farmers side by side in saying no to the Treasury and the new government around the fact that this is the wrong policy to take. ""It will have more implications for farmers here than it will for farmers across the water."" Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir said that there is ""is a lot of anxiety and anger"" in relation to the issue of inheritance tax. He added that this stems from ""the UK government's failure to engage"". Muir added that farmers do have a case and that there would be a ""disproportionate and detrimental impact towards farming in Northern Ireland, because it is made up of family farms"". He said that the UK government needs to ""have a bit of reflection"" and ""a bit more engagement around these issues"". UFU's Mr Irvine, also speaking to the podcast, said in a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn he continued to apply pressure. ""We have smaller farm businesses, but we've a significantly higher land value and that leaves us vulnerable. ""The £1m threshold only lets a relatively small holding avoid this tax."" The chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi MP, said the union had given evidence to it. ""We are aware how it is disproportionate in Northern Ireland, how the inheritance tax will affect them. We are aware and have raised our concerns with government and will continue to do so."" Speaking earlier to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Muir said he had ""been looking forward to the show for months"". ""This is a real proud celebration of agri-food in Northern Ireland and there is so much we can be proud of,"" he said. ""The real favourite part for me is being able to see all the fantastic animals that we have here. ""There's so many examples in terms of pigs, sheep and there is the cattle ring. ""We have the highest welfare standards in Northern Ireland and we should be able to showcase that to so many people."" More than 3,500 animals will be on display over the course of four days. Although there will not be any poultry competitions this year because ofbird flu restrictions, there will be countless cattle, sheep, pig and horse competitions, not to mention the guinea pigs, rabbits and a small display of birds from a single flock. The show has evolved over the years to reflect the changing face of agriculture. A sustainability village will showcase the green innovations being introduced in farming to help reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. And the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) will be demonstrating a model farm of the future. Prof Elizabeth Magowan from AFBI said Balmoral was the ""perfect platform"" to share the scientific work they do to develop farming systems that are both environmentally and economically responsible. ""The AFBI team get a lot of value from the many discussions that take place with our farming community and the wider community who attend the show. ""We often learn as much from the folk that visit the stand as they learn from us."" The Balmoral Show takes place at the Eikon Exhibition Centre at Lisburn's Balmoral Park. The show runs over four days from Wednesday to Saturday and opens at 09:30 BST each day. It closes at 18:00 on Wednesday and Saturday, 20:00 on Thursday and 19:00 on Friday. Those travelling to the event are encouraged to make use of public transport. If you are travelling by train, the nearest station is at Lisburn which is less than 15 minutes away from the event. A free shuttle service will run from the station to the showgrounds, operating regularly throughout the day. The last shuttle bus will leave 30 minutes after the show closes each day. By car: Car parking is available on site for £10 per car each day, which must be paid by cash on arrival. Organisers have warned there will be queues arriving and leaving the showgrounds at peak times. Tickets must be bought online in advance and cannot be purchased at the gate.

774685,Plans for battery energy storage site proposed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqglv98dn4o,"Plans have been unveiled to house more than 100 batteries in storage containers on farmland near a Kent village. Anglo Renewables has applied to Dartford Borough Council for planning permission for the energy storage facility in Greenhithe. Documents submitted to the authority on 29 April said the renewables firm wants to build a battery energy storage system (BESS) off Bean Lane in Greenhithe. It is not yet known when the planning committee will decide on the bid although a target deadline of 29 July has been set, while the public can comment on the plans until 30 May, reports theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. ""The site comprises a 3.7 hectare [9 acre] parcel of land that is currently in agricultural use,"" the company wrote. It insists that as the proposal is ""fully reversible"", any land would not be ""permanently or irreversibly lost,"" and only about half the farmland will be built on. BESS systems are intended to store energy, largely from renewable sources, so that it can be deployed into the grid when there is demand to avoid wasting energy. ""The 104 megawatts of storage of the site can meet the average electricity needs of 215,000 homes for two hours,"" planning documents said The batteries themselves will be stored in metal containers ""similar in appearance to a ubiquitous profiled steel shipping container."" The site is set to have 24/7 CCTV coverage and fences all around. Anglo Renewables also say there will be a ""biodiversity net gain"" as part of their plans through a ""broadleaved planting area"" forming ""an extension to Darenth Wood"". They also propose that the development will only be temporary, and after 40 years the facility will be decommissioned and removed, and the land returned to agricultural use.

But the effects of age catch up with even the king of the jungle with the news that Hugo the 17-year-old lion has died. Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo in Pembrokeshire announced ""with heavy hearts"" the passing of their beloved male African lion following a short illness. ""Our thoughts are with our keeping team who are feeling his loss most deeply,"" it said in a statement. Hugo arrived at the attraction near Tenby in 2014 with his mate Luna and their four cubs - Sola, Zahra, Alika, and Ebele - and swiftly became a ""firm favourite"" among staff and visitors. Following the illness it was discovered he was suffering from chronic kidney disease, a progressive and irreversible condition common in older big cats. The decision was taken to put him down due to his age, given more episodes of illness were likely. ""It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved Hugo,"" the statement read. ""His recent illness was determined to be an uraemic episode and sadly, more episodes were likely. ""Following an ethical review and given Hugo's age and the nature of his condition, the difficult but humane decision to provide a dignified goodbye to him was taken to prevent further suffering."" It is the second to be born there since October and is vital for the breed's future, keepers say. The breed is known for distinctive spiky yellow eyebrows.

The three Bronze Age objects were found in March 2022 and date back to about 1400–1150 BCE. Known as the Crichel Hoard, the bent ornaments have been valued at £9,000 and Dorset Museum is fundraising to acquire, conserve and display them. The museum said they shed ""new light on Bronze Age life in southern England"". The collection is made up of a twisted gold ribbon torc bracelet, a gold strip thought to be part of a larger piece of jewellery, and a spiralled gold bracelet weighing 46g (1.6 oz). Jon Marrow, of Dorset Museum, said: ""One of the most interesting things about this hoard is that the gold twisted torc is of a type normally found further north and west. ""It's also intriguing that such objects are so often damaged before burial, as though this was done ritually but it's hard for us to discern what the beliefs were behind this practice."" The museum said £8,000 had already been raised through the Arts Council England and V&A Purchase Grant Fund, and The Headley Trust. A spokesperson said: ""Artefacts like these are exceptionally rare in this region and significantly deepen our understanding of early gold working, social structures, and cultural practices over three millennia ago.""

605215,Onshore wind farm project within budget - chairman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80kv5d7lp7o,"The initial costs of an onshore wind farm project have been higher than expected but the scheme is still within budget, the chairman of Manx Utilities has said. John Wannenburgh MHK confirmed £3.14m had so far been spent on ""predevelopment costs"" for the Cair Vie project at Earystane and Scard in the south of the Isle of Man. Although ""additional survey work"" was required after environmental scoping feedback, the government-owned firm believed the plan remained ""financially viable"", he said. Concerns were raised about ""rising costs"" in the House of Keys on Tuesday, with calls for the project to be scrapped or moved to another site. The proposed plans, which would see up to five turbines built in the area able to deliver a quarter of the island's annual electricity needs, are part of the government's commitment to decarbonise the island's energy supply by 2030. There were calls by Chris Thomas MHK for the scheme to be moved as the current £40m projected cost was in line with that outlined previously for a scheme at Sulby and Druidale in the north of the island. Jason Moorhouse MHK questioned if the cost of the project had ""almost doubled"" when compared to paperwork issued by Manx Utilities in July 2023 that put the price of the scheme at £23.5m. In response, Wannenburgh said that lower figure had been the ""indicative"" price of the components needed at the time, but not the full cost of the overall project. He said predevelopment costs for onshore wind farms were typically 10% to 15% of the overall spend. That had so far covered ecological surveys, feasibility work, consultants, project management and network connection investigations, he said. It had also involved engaging with stakeholders, and the additional ecological surveys, which were underway following feedback on the environmental scoping report. The £40m overall figure was ""consistent"" with the original costsoutlined by Manx Utilitiesin July 2023 and it would be ""irresponsible"" to stop the process and relocate, he said. ""We must see the process though from where it is, and we will make final decisions when the final environmental impact assessment is reported,"" he added.

913181,Ancient woodland nature reserve to expand,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jwwyjzr1o,"A conservation charity has acquired 100 acres of ancient woodland to expand an existing nature reserve. The Norfolk Wildlife Trust said that the new land would increase the size of its reserve at Foxley Wood, in North Norfolk, by more than a third. Parts of the woodland are known to have been there for 6,000 years, and it has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its value for wildlife. Steve Collin, an area manager for the trust, said they intended to use the expanded area to create a ""mosaic of habitats"". The Wildlife Trust said that the purchase of the land next to their existing reserve was made possible by several donations. They said that the most significant of these had come from legacies left to the trust by Graham Churchyard and Adrian Gunson. Tricia Gunson, Adrian's widow, is a ""wildlife guardian"" for the Trust. She said she was ""very happy to release Adrian's legacy to help with this purchase"", because they had ""always loved Norfolk, and its rich and varied wildlife"". Foxley Wood is Norfolk's largest area of ancient woodland. As well as using the expanded area to increase visitor access, the trust said it also hoped to create new habitats for rare plant life. Steve Collin, from the trust, explained that the wildlife they hoped the resulting plants would encourage included ""butterflies such as purple emperor and silver washed fritillary and birds including tree creepers and nuthatches"". ""We will create new and eco-friendly ways for people to enjoy some of Norfolk's most special wild places,"" he said. An animal charity says it is ""deflated"" by the latest incident.

998982,Endangered Indian rhino calf born at safari park,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9ygew7yn2o,"Keepers at a safari park have welcomed the birth of a rare Indian rhinoceros calf. The baby rhino arrived at West Midlands Safari Park (WMSP) in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 6 May. The female calf is the second successful Indian rhino birth at the Park in its 52-year history - the first was the calf's half-brother in 2020. The safari park said both mum and baby were doing well, after keepers had to step in to assist with the birth. Veterinary nurse Sarah Smith said: ""After a long, restless night monitoring the CCTV, the team continued their normal morning checks and found her behavioural changes that confirmed her labour was progressing. ""When we hadn't seen the usual progression we expected, closer inspection showed us there were back feet visible, telling us we had an abnormal delivery."" The Indian rhino, also known as greater one-horned rhino, is classed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. They are found in India and Nepal, but face threats such as poaching, habitat destruction and conflict with humans. In the 19th Century they were hunted almost to extinction. ""A breech birth brings many difficulties, and research shows a large number require intervention and usually end in calf mortality. ""This can also lead to the mother's life being in danger, so we knew we had a short window of time to act. We were able to apply calving ropes to the calf's hind legs and assist Sunny with her contractions and help birth the calf. ""We're so proud of her and the team,"" Ms Smith added.

549956,Balmoral Show is a 'day out' amid tense time for farmers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3jlrjyn1o,"The 156th Balmoral Show starts on Wednesday, with all shades of agriculture coming together to put on a spectacle. But behind the shop window, farmers say they are under more pressure than ever. Bovine TB levels remain at near-record levels, while a housing order imposed to protect the commercial poultry industry frombird flu has just been lifted after almost 12 weeks. And thebiggest shake-up in inheritance tax in a generationcontinues to cause stress for farming families. Despite prices for commodities like beef and milk remaining high, it all makes for a less-than-positive backdrop to a highlight in the farming calendar. For Cormac McKervey, head of agriculture at Ulster Bank, the show has a role to play in connecting farmers with the public they serve. ""It lets them understand and know that what we're doing is good, it's wholesome, it's natural food."" But agriculture is still Northern Ireland's largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. And reducing that is a challenge that Mr McKervey says is on the minds of farmers. ""Farming does produce a lot of carbon emissions, but equally, farming has some fantastic solutions in terms of absorbing that carbon into the soil,"" he said. ""And I think the conversation has widened, that it's not just purely carbon anymore, it's that wider piece about sustainability on the farm, both economically and environmentally. ""Farmers are getting into that and the supply chain is driving it."" William Irvine, president of the Ulster Farmers' Union, knows his members will have a lot to discuss when the Union's tent opens for tea and scones on Wednesday. ""I could almost guarantee that the majority of questions that we will get will be the inheritance tax piece, the TB piece, closely followed I would say by the Nutrients Action Programme consultation that's just been announced in recent days,"" Mr Irvine said. ""It feels like there is a tsunami coming at us around all of these issues."" Sean McAuley has felt the impact of part of that tsunami. After 40 years in farming, he had his first experience of bovine TB in 2023-24. ""It was a shock to the system.  I wasn't that well at the time; I was waiting to go into hospital,"" Mr McAuley said. ""I can fully relate now to the pressures it puts farmers and their families under because you see your business disappearing."" The Farmers for Action spokesperson is adamant that no strategy will tackle the problem until there is a wildlife intervention - a badger cull, by another name. But thecourts have quashed the previous minister's order for a cull. With the bill for the TB programme expected to reach £60m this year,the TB Partnership Steering Group has published a blueprint for eradication. It said it will ""bring forward proposals for effective, evidence-based wildlife interventions and TBPSG views for consideration by [the] minister"". Frustrations withthe planning systemfelt in other sectors are also affecting farming. ""I have one son who would be interested in farming,"" said Mr McAuley. ""We have been looking recently at perhaps other ventures on the farm, but the big stumbling block is going to be planning, and that is a big issue for anyone who wants to invest into the industry at the minute."" Amid all the troubles, the Balmoral Show remains ""a real celebration"" to look forward to for Mr Irvine. ""Balmoral is a day out, a day to meet folk that we maybe didn't meet since this time last year, it's a day to enjoy, a day to catch up with our friends and colleague,"" he said. ""It's a shop window for our pedigree breeders, our livestock breeders, and all the various sectors within agriculture will be represented at the show. ""I'm quite sure people will be there to enjoy their day, even with all the challenges that are coming at them."" The Balmoral Show takes place at the Eikon Centre, not far from Lisburn. The show runs on four days from Wednesday to Saturday and opens at 09:30 BST each day. It closes at 18:00 on Wednesday and Saturday, 20:00 on Thursday and 19:00 on Friday. Tickets must be bought online in advance and cannot be purchased at the gate. Early bird tickets are available to purchase on the Balmoral Show website before 22:00 on Tuesday.

316514,Map shows 80% of peatlands dry and degraded,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8zg4y8979o,"New mapping data has shown 80% of England's peatlands to be dry and damaged. The government said the findings, shown on anopen source map, presented a worrying picture, with degraded peat emitting carbon into the atmosphere and contributing to global heating. Healthy peat is thecountry's biggest carbon storebut when damaged it releases planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the most extensive peatland habitat was shown to be found across parts of the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors and in the uplands of the south-west of England. Scientists have used satellite imagery, artificial intelligence and in-depth data analysis to create the most complete map of England's peatland and peaty soils to date, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. As vital carbon sinks, healthy peatlands can help tackle climate change, reduce flood risk, improve water quality and support rare wildlife, including the golden plover, curlews and 25 species of dragonflies. The map models the extent, depth and important aspects of the condition of England's peat, including vegetation, gullies and man-made as well as natural draining channels. It found that peaty soil covers roughly 8.5% of England's surface with four-fifths of England's peatlands also revealed to be in a dry and degraded state. The map showed that three-quarters of the surface was shown to be covered by plants and land use types associated with dryer conditions such as heather, while only 1% is covered by important peat-forming plants such as sphagnum moss. Cumbria Wildlife Trust said it was looking torestore some of its peatlands, which were historically burnedto help heat homes last year. Meanwhile, in Dartmoor, the University of Exeter estimates just 1% of its deep peat is healthy, peat-forming bog. Efforts to restore this vital natural resource are under way, including in Exmoor, Dartmoor and Cornwall, but scientists are warning climate change could make that difficult. Natural England's chief scientist, Dr Sallie Bailey, said: ""Mapping peat to this level of detail will help us maximise the benefits of peat and massively advances our understanding the role our peatlands are playing in a changing climate."" Tony Juniper, chairman of Natural England, said the map ""would allow us to make far better and more informed decisions when it comes to managing peatlands - targeting restoration efforts to the most degraded peat and identifying the best opportunities for nature recovery"".

1043094,Scientists in a race to discover why our Universe exists,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwvgevjjl6o,"Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist? They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead. The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers. The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison. The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as ""cathedrals to science"". Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) for nearly ten years. They seal DUNE off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage. ""We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,"" he says. When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite. Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are. Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino. They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away. This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly. The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out. Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be ""transformative"" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself. ""It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,"" she said. Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it shines like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K. The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe. ""We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,"" he says. Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, ""I would like to get there first!""  But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the DUNE project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on. ""There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently"". The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery – for now. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, ""space archaeologists"" are scrambling to save what's left. Astronomers have spotted around a dozen of these weird, rare blasts. Could they be signs of a special kind of black hole? The ""Blue Marble"" was the first photo of the whole Earth and the only ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface. The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut. Scientists find new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.

997507,Damaged pipes blamed for surge in sewage alerts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1757zgdzx9o,"A water company says damaged pipes and broken valves are to blame for an increase in the number of sewage pollution alerts on an East Yorkshire beach. Data from Surfers Against Sewage shows there were 31 alerts in 2024, compared with four in 2022. Yorkshire Water said the alert system had been accidentally triggered due to two damaged outflow pipes and two damaged valves which had been letting in seawater. The company said it was spending £1.3m on repairs. When investigating the spill alerts, engineers discovered ground subsidence had caused damage to two underground pipes. A plastic pipe was found compressed into an oval shape and a concrete pipe had partially collapsed, allowing groundwater into the system. Two damaged valve flaps were allowing seawater to enter the combined sewer overflow and accidentally trigger pollution alerts. Miles Cameron, Yorkshire Water's bathing water strategic partnerships manager, said the repair work on the beach was part of a wider five-year £300m investment programme along the Yorkshire coast. ""It got Blue Flag status which is fantastic and gives bathers and customers the confidence they can come to Hornsea,"" he said. ""This is really just about fixing a pipe to make sure it's there for many years to come."" Visitors to Hornsea toldBBC Radio Humbersidetheir confidence in beach cleanliness had diminished. Mally Armitage said he had not used the beach due to ""the raw sewage that's been pumped into the ocean and the recent incident with the tanker"", referring toa collison between a tanker carrying aviation fuel and a cargo shipin March. Jerry Ashton said: ""You can't have inaccurate information otherwise there's no point having any information is there? ""It doesn't worry me too much but, if I was a surfer, and we do have surfers here, or one of the ladies that goes swimming in it, then I'd be extremely concerned.""

The scheme, at the University of Wolverhampton, will see heat pumps, solar panels and a heat network installed at its Walsall campus. Bosses said gas-fired equipment and boilers reaching the end of their working life would be replaced with a system that recovers heat from the air to provide low carbon heating and hot water. Chilled water will be recovered from air-source heat pumps, eliminating the need to run the chillers during summer months, they added.

750390,Artists to document rewilding project,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xndvz2qno,"A group of artists are visiting a heathland rewilding site to capture its changing flora, fauna and landscape. Thirty artists fromThe Society of Wildlife Artists(SWLA) will spend time this year atThe Massingham Heath Projectin west Norfolk. Half of the land at the 2,500-acre site (1,000 hectares) is being re-wilded to benefit nature, while half is used for conventional agriculture. An exhibition and book documenting how the landscape changes throughout the seasons are being produced. Land owner Oliver Birkbeck said: ""They're looking at the health as well as the agricultural landscape, the farm-scape because it is all part of the same story."" He described the artists as ""rock stars"" and said he was so proud for them to visit the site - which is east of King's Lynn and Sandringham. ""The job of the natural world is to in some way elevate us from the boring imperatives of our daily lives. That's also the job of the artist. So this is a marriage of the two which I think is a really beautiful thing,"" he added. Melanie Mascarenhas has a background in science and worked for many years in the NHS before joining the SWLA. She said: ""It's a huge privilege to be here, not just on the heath, which is magnificent , but to be with artists you admire. ""I've been mostly focusing on beetles and it's taken me back to the start of my wildlife drawing journey where I would always focus on invertebrates."" Artist Darren Woodhead praised the light and the way it was falling on the plants and birds. ""You feel like you are going back 100 years in this landscape,"" he said. ""I've not seen hedgerows like this, big wide hedgerows, big avenues next to them, amazing corridors for wildlife.""

429903,Farmers 'will take whatever rain we get',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cev49zkpv04o,"Farmers say they ""desperately"" need wet weather after the sunniest April on record. One farmer from Northamptonshire said he would take whatever rain he could get as both his arable crops and his fodder grass were gasping for water. Many farms suffered a bad harvest last year because of the relatively high rainfall, and are now facing the same pressure thanks to the sun. A cider maker in the county said the warm weather was making his apples sweeter and making alcohol levels ""a bit higher"". The Met Office said provisional figures showed 2025 had hadthe sunniest April since records began in 1910. There were 47% more sunshine hours than the long-term meteorological average. At Pear Tree Farm in Aldwincle near Thrapston in Northamptonshire, Tim Hankins was celebrating a small downpour on Sunday night. ""We'll take whatever we can get. We desperately, desperately need wet weather,"" he said. ""April showers - where were they?"" A thunderstorm warning has been issued forparts of the East of Englandfor Monday afternoon until 22:00 BST, including Northants. He added that he needed rain not just for his arable crops but also for the grass he grows to feed his sheep and cattle. He said his barley and wheat were ""very stressed - a bit like I am"". ""It's going a bit yellow. We've put some fertiliser on 10 days ago and I should imagine today will be the first day it actually gets into the soil,"" he said. ""We had a bad harvest last year because of all the wet weather, and now we're heading for a bad harvest again with the dry weather - unless we get some rain now."" At Overstone Grange Farm a few miles from Northampton, Tom Harris reported his fields were ""just cake and dust which you wouldn't ordinarily expect this time of year"". ""We're at the mercy of the weather unless your farm's set up for irrigation, which, in this part of the world, not many farms are,"" he said. ""All you can do is hope the weather comes good for you."" He has diversified into growing a plant that should like the sunshine - sunflowers. ""They love the sun and turn their heads turn towards it, but they went in the ground last week and they need moisture to get a bit of a start,"" he said. At Saxby's Cider in Farndish near Wellingborough, the fruit Phil Saxby and the team rely on is not quite as dependant on good weather. He said apples had ""got deep roots and there's moisture further down so there's not so much of a panic"". ""If you have a very dry year, we find that the apples generally are a little bit smaller and they're a little bit sweeter so there's a little bit more sugar in there so the alcohol levels are generally a bit higher,"" he said.

280955,Pair ordered to pay £11k over animal cruelty,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1n8ll54xo,"A pair of smallholders who ""failed to provide the most basic care"" have been banned from keeping farm animals for five years and orderd to pay more than £11,000. Paul Ford and Rebecca Austin, of Little Chacewood Farm and Farm Shop, Truro, pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to five charges of animal cruelty involving poultry and pigs. The court heard how Cornwall Council's animal health and environmental health teams had previously visited the smallholding and provided advice and guidance, which was ignored. Ford and Austin, both aged 35, were ordered to pay a total of £11,423 in fines and court costs. Stephanie Martin, senior Trading Standards officer at Cornwall Council, said: ""Mr Ford and Miss Austin had been offered considerable advice over a number of years. ""They completely ignored this advice and failed to provide the most basic care to their animals."" The court was told at the hearing last Thursday how the pair failed to provide bedding and fresh water and kept the animals in hazardous conditions where there was scrap metal, old machinery and live electrical wires. It also heard how Ford and Austin failed to correctly store and dispose poultry slaughter waste and failed to control a rat infestation. Kevin Brader, head of Public Protection at Cornwall Council, said: ""This case is a distressing example of smallholders attempting to farm without the appropriate knowledge. ""Where individuals do not provide adequate care for their animals, we will take enforcement action to safeguard industry standards."" Ford was ordered to pay a fine of £778, a surcharge of £311, and to contribute £8,000 towards the council's costs.

413046,Refund delays for solar power firm customers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15v5de97dgo,"A solar power firm has warned customers of delays to refunds after it was delisted from a council-endorsed energy scheme. Clients paid thousands of pounds upfront to Fusion8 Ltd to install solar panels and batteries under Solar Together, a commercial scheme promoted by several local authorities. Some clients have tried to reclaim deposits of up to £2,000 after the firm lost a vital accreditation. In a statement, Fusion8 said it had been processing refunds, although it told customers on 1 May the process was on hold. iChoosr, which operates the Solar Together scheme, told the BBC it has offered affected customers installations at the same price from other installers and vowed to reimburse those who cannot get a refund from Fusion8. Simon Haythornthwaite, from Romsey, Hampshire, paid a £1,700 deposit to Fusion8 and had a home visit from the firm in January. However, he said he heard nothing further until March, when the company increased its £7,083 quote by a further £930. In April, he was informed by iChoosr that Fusion8 would no longer be able to carry out the work. Mr Haythornthwaite said Fusion8 did not respond to his request on 23 April for a refund. On 1 May, Fusion8 sent an email which said: ""We are currently experiencing issues that is preventing us from processing refund requests. ""Until a resolution is found, we are unfortunately not able to respond to emails regarding refunds."" Mr Haythornthwaite told the BBC: ""When you get an email saying they are not responding to emails, it doesn't give you a warm, fuzzy feeling. ""I imagine we are going to have trouble getting this deposit back. ""Having spoken to a local installer, I wish I hadn't done this at all. The price was not that different."" Solar Together is a solar panel and battery storage installation scheme, operated by iChoosr and offered through local authorities. Its website says it delivers better prices for renewable energy through group buying. Another Solar Together customer interviewed by the BBC said he heard nothing from the company for two months after an initial consultation. The client from Hythe, Hampshire, who prefers not to be named, said he was later told installers would arrive within a week, but no-one came. After trying to reclaim a £2,000 deposit, he was sent the same email as Mr Haythornthwaite on 1 May. More than a dozen Fusion8 customers in Berkshire and Hampshire complained about the firm in Trustpilot reviews in April. There was one positive review. The complaints mentioned ""no communication"", ""slow progress"" and customers being left with scaffolding around their homes when work stalled. In a statement, Fusion8 said it was ""no longer performing installations as part of the Solar Together scheme"". It added: ""Fusion8 has been processing refunds and is working hard to communicate with customers who have paid a deposit. ""Those customers who are deciding to continue their installation with Fusion8 are having their installations planned and prepared."" In an internal email seen by the BBC, Hampshire County Council chief executive Carolyn Williamson said Fusion8 was no longer part of Solar Together Hampshire ""due to the loss of their Customer Code accreditation, which is a MCS [certification scheme] requirement"". She said 94 Fusion8 clients in the county were affected. In a statement, the council said customers should contact iChoosr to arrange a full refund. An iChoosr spokesman said: ""We have advised customers who have paid a deposit to request a refund from Fusion8. ""These customers have been offered an installation at the same price from another installer already operating in their region as part of Solar Together. ""If their refund is not made by Fusion8, we are helping customers understand the alternative routes to a refund via their card provider using Section 75 and Chargeback. ""Where this is not possible, despite having no legal or contractual commitment, iChoosr will reimburse the customers their deposit.""

352390,Forensic spray helping women to 'feel safer',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly392d3el1o,"Victims of domestic violence are being given a forensic spray that proves if a perpetrator has approached them. SmartWater, which has its own DNA, will remain on the suspect's skin for up to six weeks and can help lead to convictions. Perpetrators are told that victims are carrying the spray in a bid to deter them from contacting the victim. Gloucestershire Police has been trialling SmartWater since January, with early feedback suggesting it is working. Ch Insp Ash Shingler said: ""We're working with seven victims. None of the SmartWater has been deployed - that's a good sign because it means the preventative element seems to be working.""  The invisible fluid, traditionally used to mark items such as bikes and valuables, is now being given to high-risk victims of domestic abuse. They can use the spray to prove a perpetrator did approach them or break their bail conditions or banning orders. When deployed the substance can be used as evidence. Forensic laboratories only need a tiny amount on someone's skin or clothing to prove they were sprayed with it. Ch Insp Shingler said: ""The spray has individual codes, the substance shows up under UV light and the code itself is unique to the spray and registered to the victim. ""Once it's sent to the lab, it can be viewed like a barcode – it's got it's own DNA."" Clare Joynes, the rural domestic abuse coordinator for Gloucestershire Domestic Abuse Support Service, said the positive ""psychological impact"" for victims knowing they could use the spray was significant. Victims often felt like they could not ""trust the world anymore"", said Ms Joynes, adding ""anything like this [pilot] that makes people feel safer"" is a good thing. Feeling safer going out and answering their front door is ""going to be massive in terms of the psychological impact and their ability to recover"", she added.

802458,How to avoid a puncture on the Moon,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrve1zrlg3o,"Going back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel. After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat. ""One thing you cannot have is a puncture,"" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin. The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover. Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears. As for the Moon, the US Artemis missionsaim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027. Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030. The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface. ""The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,"" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand. ""We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,"" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio. One big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges. At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving. And that's a problem for tyres. ""Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,"" says Dr Padula. The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape. ""If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,"" says Dr Padula. The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in. The next space missions will need to drive round ""bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger"", he says. And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon. Apollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles. Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres. ""In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,"" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028. One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium. ""Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company. He calls nitinol's flexible properties ""one of the craziest things you will ever see"". Nitinol is a potentially ""revolutionary"" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says. However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon. Bridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels. Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil. Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex. The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface. Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May). Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them. Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface. Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes. ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet. The work might have some useful applications here on Earth. While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre. An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres. Priced around $150 (£120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable. He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads. For all this, his ""dream"" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon. ""So, I can tell my kids, look up there on the Moon,"" he says. ""Daddy's tyres are up there."" More trade union members are murdered in the South American nation than anywhere else. The previous government had said autonomous vehicles were ""set to be on the road"" by 2026.

962370,Hedgehog study launched to fight falling numbers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780dvl81dlo,"A university is rolling out new plans to help provide more safe spaces for hedgehogs across its campuses. The University of Brighton said it wanted to help protect hedgehogs across its sites to try to combat rapidly falling population numbers across the UK. Staff and students from the institution began a survey on Monday to track the number of hedgehogs across the university's three campuses ahead of plans to turn green spaces into hedgehog havens. Izzy White, sustainability projects officer at the university, said the survey would ""provide us with a real insight"" into local population numbers and shape further conservation work. Survey works see students placing ""tracking tunnels"", which use ink pads and paper to log paw prints, across the university's campuses in Falmer, Moulsecoomb and the city centre. The results will then be used to decide where to target support based on where the hedgehogs are living on the university's grounds. Ms White added: ""It's about making practical changes like creating safe spaces and removing hazards to reduce the impact campus life has on local wildlife. ""We're proud to take an active role in protecting local biodiversity and equipping our students with the tools to make a difference."" Experts from The British Hedgehog Preservation Society said in October that population numbers across the UK had halved over the space of the last decade. Steps people can take to help hedgehogs in their own back gardens include leaving small holes in the bottom of fences to help them get around and giving them leaves and foliage to hide under.

Matthew Pidden, a 22-year-old University of Bristol student, built and trained the ""Revenger"" over 15 weeks for his computer science bachelor's degree. The robot solved the cube in 45.305 seconds, obliterating the world record of 1 minute 18 seconds. However, the human record for solving the cube is 15.71 seconds. ""I was into Rubik's cubes as a kid. For my final project, I wanted to do something I was actually excited about,"" Mr Pidden told BBC Points West. ""Mathematically, they're really interesting,"" he said. ""I watched a video solving a Rubik's cube and thought it was so fun."" Mr Pidden's robot uses dual webcams to scan the cube, a custom mechanism to manipulate the faces, and a fully self-built solving algorithm to generate efficient solutions. The student now plans to study for a master's degree in robotics at Imperial College London. The Rubik's cube is a combination puzzle invented by Hungarian sculptor Ernő Rubik in 1974. The goal of the puzzle is to arrange the squares so that each of the faces of the cube displays a single colour. The original version has three-by-three squares on each face. The four-by-four, also known as ""Rubik's Revenge"", was invented by Hungarian Péter Sebestény in 1981.  Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

888466,Public inquiry into huge solar farm to begin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071e40yreko,"A public inquiry into plans to build one of Europe's largest solar farms begins on Tuesday. For the next three days, open floor hearings will take place as part of the Planning Inspectorate's examination of thecontroversial Botley West scheme in Oxford. The £800m farm would cover 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of countryside north of Woodstock, west of Kidlington and west of Botley. It is considered a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, meaning the application must be considered by the government, not local councils. The plan hassplit opinion, with developer Photo Vault Development Partners saying large-scale solar energy is crucial to meet the UK's climate targets, while local politicians and opponents calling it a cause of concern. Campaigners also want Blenheim Palace, which owns 90% of the land, to use its influence to press for 2% of the project's annual revenue, instead of the proposed 0.2%, to be allocated to benefit local communities. Blenheim Palace said: ""As we lend our land to this project we do so knowing it could deliver enough clean energy to power 330,000 homes, helping Oxfordshire's homes to be self-sufficient, whilst supporting our collective declarations in the battle against the climate emergency."" It added it knew the arguments both for and against the development and it did not think those were ""exclusive of one another"". Social enterprise The Low Carbon Hub has been running the Make Botley West Solar Farm Fair campaign, which is focused on ensuring the project delivers ""real and lasting benefits to the local communities that will host it"". It said ithad estimatedin the first year 2% of revenue would create £840,000 in community benefit, but it added until the project was up and running it was ""very difficult"" to know the precise figure. ""Our proposed 2% of revenue model ensures communities receive a fair and proportionate benefit, one that is tied to the actual performance of the project – if that does well, then communities also benefit,"" it said. West Oxfordshire District Council has previously said the scale of the solar park had ""potential for significant and widespread positive and negative impacts"". As part of the planning process, relevant parties, including the local authorities in which the development sits, can submit their response to the plans.

385046,Ecologists and children study nature in 'bioblitz',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy64lpznp6o,"Ecologists and primary schoolchildren are taking part in a ""bioblitz"" this week, where they record as many living things as possible within a 24-hour period. Organised by the Nature Commission in partnership with La Société Guernesiaise, the event aimed to measure how the presence of different species changed over time, organisers said. Bioblitz 2025 was taking place at L'Ancresse East, which was last surveyed in 2019, they added. The results are due to be announced to more than 300 children at the end of the week. The recording began on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, the records will be shared with children from seven schools visiting the area. The children were hearing about the project and taking part in rock-pooling, bird watching, identifying important plants, minibeast spotting and finding out about local bats, leaders said. Angela Salmon, head of operations and education at the Nature Commission, said: ""We've got botanists, entomologists looking for all things insect, ornithologists looking at birds from dawn, and marine experts down on the beach. ""All this information goes into the Guernsey Biological Records Centre, so, if there are any other surveys on this site, we can see what's changing. ""There are so many children who are losing that connection with nature, and don't know the name of really common plants and animals. We want them to become familiar with what's here on their doorstep."" Jessi Jennings is one of the Nature Commission's marine biologists recording life in the rockpools. She said: ""We've seen lots of different algae, and lots of different crabs [so far]... There's a lot of life down here. ""Last year, the kids absolutely loved it.

549837,Iran's Khamenei doubts US nuclear talks will lead to agreement,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp855k42wpko,"Iran's Supreme Leader has expressed doubt that nuclear talks with the US will lead to a new agreement, saying it had made ""excessive and outrageous"" demands on uranium enrichment. ""We don't think it will lead to any outcome. We don't know what will happen,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said. US President Donald Trump said last week that Iran had ""sort of"" agreed to the terms of a deal following four rounds of talks mediated by Oman since 12 April. But ahead of another round scheduled for this weekend, Iran's chief negotiator rejected his US counterpart's assertion that it would have to commit to stop producing enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. Trump, who pulled the US out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers during his first term in office, has warned Iran that it could face US and Israeli military action if the talks are not successful. Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. However, it has breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs. Khamenei addressed the latest developments in Iran's negotiations with the US at a ceremony honouring late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash one year ago. He praised Raisi, a fellow hardline cleric, for refusing direct talks with the US while in office. ""He clearly said 'no' without ambiguity,"" Khamanei noted, adding that Raisi did not let enemies ""drag Iran to the negotiating table through threats or tricks"". Khamenei said nuclear talks under Raisi's predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, had failed to achieve results, and that he did not think there would be any breakthrough under his successor, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is a reformist. The supreme leader also criticised the Trump administration's approach, saying: ""The American side in these indirect talks should avoid nonsensical remarks."" ""Saying they will not allow Iran to enrich is a big mistake. No-one waits for their permission."" US special envoy Steve Witkoff told ABC News in an interview on Sunday: ""We cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability. We've delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them."" He added: ""We want to get to a solution here. And we think that will be able to."" ""But everything begins from our standpoint with a deal that does not include enrichment. We cannot have that. Because enrichment enables weaponisation, and we will not allow a bomb to get here."" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi swiftly responded by warning Witkoff: ""Unrealistic expectations stop negotiations, enrichment in Iran is not something that can be stopped."" ""I think he is completely at a distance from the reality of the negotiations,"" he added. The 2015 deal that Iran reached with then-US President Barack Obama's administration, as well as the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, saw it limit its nuclear activities and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief. Iran was only permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity, which can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. In February, the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that Iran had stockpiled almost 275kg (606lb) of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is near weapons grade. That would theoretically be enough, if enriched to 90%, for six nuclear bombs. A scuffle broke out during a visit by Democratic lawmakers, but LaMonica McIver says the case against her is political.

704096,US congresswoman charged with assault outside immigration centre,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywwqedpl4o,"Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is being charged with assault after a confrontation with officers outside an immigration detention centre. Alina Habba - the interim US attorney for the state and an ally of President Donald Trump - announced the charges in a social media post late on Monday. Habba also said that her office would be dropping a trespassing case against the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who is another Democratic politician. Scuffles broke out when McIver, Baraka and others paid an oversight visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) centre in Newark on 9 May. No injuries were reported. The Democratic lawmakers were visiting Delaney Hall, which can hold up to 1,000 people and was touted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the first reopened immigration facility under the new Trump administration. Videos showed increasingly heated discussion and a chaotic scene including police, Ice agents, journalists, the politicians and protesters before Mayor Baraka was arrested. The members of Congress present were eventually granted access and given a tour of the building. Administration officials and the Democratic lawmakers opposed to the Ice facility each blamed each other for the scuffles. DHS said the politicians ""stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility."" Commenting on the case on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that McIver had been ""out of control"". McIver denied wrongdoing and called the case against her ""purely political"", while leading congressional Democrats issued a statement saying the charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement ""is extreme, morally bankrupt and lacks any basis in law or fact"". Baraka said the videos taken during the incident ""make it clear that Delaney Hall personnel opened the gate for me, and allowed me to enter the property, as well as my calm and respectful departure when asked to leave"". In dropping the charge against the mayor, Habba, who previously worked as a lawyer for Trump, said she would personally give Baraka a tour of the facility. Government-funded welfare programmes have become a major point of contention in Trump's tax bill. The news that he has ""aggressive"" prostate cancer has some medics asking why it was not detected sooner. It follows Donald Trump saying Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately"" start negotiating, after a two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin. ""We don't think it will lead to any outcome,"" the supreme leader warns, saying the US is making ""outrageous"" demands on uranium enrichment.

856349,Vietnamese beauty queen arrested for fraud over fibre gummies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e33dvpgxro,"Vietnamese authorities have arrested a beauty queen and social media influencer for consumer fraud after she promoted a counterfeit fibre supplement. Nguyen Thuc Thuy Tien had heavily marketed gummies said to be rich in fibre on her social media channels. But a public backlash erupted after product tests revealed this was untrue. A former winner of the Miss Grand International beauty competition, Ms Nguyen is a well-known personality in Vietnam and previously received accolades from the government. Ms Nguyen had promoted Kera Supergreens Gummies along with social media influencers, Pham Quang Linh and Hang Du Muc. Investigators said the product was the result of a joint venture between Ms Nguyen and a company set up by the two other influencers. The influencers claimed that each of their gummies contained fibre equivalent to a plate of vegetables. A member of the public sent the product for testing at a lab, which found that each gummy only contained 16mg of fibre, far from 200mg as claimed. Authorities then launched an investigation, which found that sub-standard ingredients that were low in fibre were used in the manufacture of the gummies. The product's packaging also did not state the fibre content, nor did it state that the product contained a high level of sorbitol, which is used in laxatives.  The three influencers were fined in March, and apologised to the public. The following month, Vietnamese authorities arrested Mr Pham and Hang Du Muc as well as officials from their company and the gummies' manufacturer. They were charged with producing counterfeit goods and defrauding customers. On Monday, authorities announced the arrest of Ms Nguyen for allegedly deceiving customers. More than 100,000 boxes of the gummies were reportedly sold before sales were halted due to the scandal. After winning the Bangkok-based beauty pageant in 2021, Ms Nguyen became a celebrity sought after by many Vietnamese brands, and appeared on several reality TV shows. She also received certificates of merit from the prime minister and Vietnam's ruling Communist Party.

918243,India's 'Silicon Valley' flooded after heavy rains,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7800l27ynzo,"Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. The city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. Three people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday. Bengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. Many parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. This is ""rare"" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. Apart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. In one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee. Videos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. Authorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to ""rectify"" the situation. ""There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,"" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. But officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. ""No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,"" a user wrote on X. Annu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. ""Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,"" she said. Itty, who works in public policy, says a ""lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits"", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. Karnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure. The BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, £87.5m) for relief operations. The state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues. ""The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,"" Shivakumar said. Floods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis. Ananda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused ""discomfort and inconvenience"" for businesses. ""Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,"" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure.  Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets were battle tested for the first time during hostilities with India. The father of Malhotra, the Indian travel influencer, has denied allegations that she was a spy for Pakistan. Lovina Shenoy says she felt adrift as an immigrant in London so took matters into her own hands. The US-China trade ""reset"" could stall the manufacturing investment coming into India, say experts.

330097,Solving the mystery of a dinosaur mass grave at the 'River of Death',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k3x8lmje1o,"Hidden beneath the slopes of a lush forest in Alberta, Canada, is a mass grave on a monumental scale. Thousands of dinosaurs were buried here, killed in an instant on a day of utter devastation. Now, a group of palaeontologists have come to Pipestone Creek - appropriately nicknamed the ""River of Death"" - to help solve a 72-million-year-old enigma: how did they die? Trying to work out exactly what happened here starts with the hefty strike of a sledgehammer. Brute force is needed to crack open the thick layer of rock that covers what Professor Emily Bamforth, who's leading the dig, describes as ""palaeo gold"". As her team begins the more delicate job of removing the layers of dirt and dust, a jumble of fossilised bones slowly begins to emerge. ""That big blob of bone right there is, we think, part of a hip,"" Prof Bamforth says, watched on by her dog Aster - whose job today is to bark if she spots any nearby bears. ""Then here, we have all of these long, skinny bones. These are all ribs. And this is a neat one - it's part of a toe bone. This one here, we have no idea what it is - it's a great example of a Pipestone Creek mystery."" BBC News has come to Pipestone Creek to witness the sheer scale of this prehistoric graveyard and see how researchers are piecing together the clues. Thousands of fossils have been collected from the site, and are constantly generatingnew discoveries. The bones all belong to a dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus. The species, and Prof Bamforth's excavation, feature in a new landmark BBC series - Walking With Dinosaurs - which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life. These animals, which lived during the Late Cretaceous period, were a relative of the Triceratops. Measuring about five metres long and weighing two tonnes, thefour-legged beasts had large heads, adorned with a distinctive bony frill and three horns. Their defining feature was a big bump on the nose called a boss. The dig season has just started and lasts each year until autumn. The fossils in the small patch of ground that the team are working on are incredibly tightly packed; Prof Bamforth estimates there are up to 300 bones in every square metre. So far, her team has excavated an area the size of a tennis court, but the bed of bones extends for a kilometre into the hillside. ""It's jaw dropping in terms of its density,"" she tells us. ""It is, we believe, one of the largest bone beds in North America. ""More than half of the known dinosaur species in the world are described from a single specimen. We have thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus here."" Palaeontologists believe the dinosaurs were migrating together in a colossal herd for hundreds of miles from the south - where they had spent the winter - to the north for the summer. The area, which had a much warmer climate than it does today, would have been covered in rich vegetation, providing abundant food for this enormous group of plant-eating animals. ""It is a single community of a single species of animal from a snapshot in time, and it's a huge sample size. That almost never happens in the fossil record,"" says Prof Bamforth. And this patch of north-western Alberta wasn't just home to Pachyrhinosaurus. Even bigger dinosaurs roamed this land, and studying them is essential to try and understand this ancient ecosystem. Two hours drive away, we reach the Deadfall Hills. Getting there involves a hike through dense forest, wading - or doggy-paddling in the case of Aster - across a fast-running river, and clambering over slippery rocks. No digging is required here; super-sized bones lie next to the shoreline, washed out from the rock and cleaned by the flowing water, just waiting to be picked up. A huge vertebra is quickly spotted, as are bits of ribs and teeth scattered across the mud. Palaeontologist Jackson Sweder is particularly interested in what looks like a chunk of dinosaur skull. ""Most of what we find here is a duck-billed dinosaur called Edmontosaurus. If this is a skull bone, this is a dinosaur that's large - probably 30ft (10m) long,"" he says. The Edmontosaurus, another herbivore, roamed the forests like the Pachyrhinosaurus - and is helping palaeontologists build up a picture of this ancient land. Sweder is the collection manager at the Philip J Currie Dinosaur Museum in nearby Grande Prairie, where the bones from both of these giants are taken to be cleaned up and analysed. He is currently working on a huge Pachyrhinosaurus skull that's about 1.5m long and has been nicknamed ""Big Sam"". He points to where the three horns should be at the top of the frill, but the one in the middle is missing. ""All the skulls that are decently complete have a spike in that spot,"" he says. ""But its nice little unicorn spike doesn't seem to be there."" Throughout years working at the extraordinary site, the museum team has collected 8,000 dinosaur bones, and the surfaces of the lab are covered in fossils; there are bones from Pachyrhinosaurus of every size, from young to old. Having material from so many animals allows researchers to learn about dinosaur biology, answering questions about how the species grows and the make-up of the community. They can also look at individual variations, to see how one Pachyrhinosaurus could stand out from the herd – as may be the case with Big Sam and his missing spike. All of this detailed research, in the museum and at the two sites, is helping the team to answer the vital question: how did so many animals in Pipestone Creek die at the same time? ""We believe that this was a herd on a seasonal migration that got tangled up in some catastrophic event that effectively wiped out, if not the entire herd, then a good proportion of it,"" Prof Bamforth says. All the evidence suggests that this catastrophic event was a flash flood - perhaps a storm over the mountains that sent an unstoppable torrent of water towards the herd, ripping trees from their roots and shifting boulders. Prof Bamforth says the Pachyrhinosaurus wouldn't have stood a chance. ""These animals are not able to move very fast because of their sheer numbers, and they're very top heavy - and really not very good at swimming at all."" Rocks found at the site show the swirls of sediment from the fast-flowing water churning everything up. It's as if the destruction is frozen in time as a wave in the stone. But this nightmare day for the dinosaurs is now a dream for palaeontologists. ""We know, every time we come here, it's 100% guaranteed we'll find bones. And every year we discover something new about the species,"" says Prof Bamforth. ""That's why we keep coming back, because we're still finding new things."" As the team packs up their tools ready to return another day, they know there's a lot of work ahead. They've only just scratched the surface of what's here - and there are many more prehistoric secrets just waiting to be revealed.

388196,Is China the winner in the India-Pakistan conflict?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w3dln352vo,"The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory – but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner. Thelatest flare-upbegan on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutalkilling of 26people, mostlytouristsby militantsin Pahalgam on 22 April. Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied. After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets. India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance. Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims. ""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets. ""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added. India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan. A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outletsreportedplane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports. A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim. Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-upshook US giantswith its cost-effective technology. ""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC. The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict. Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems. Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale. ""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said. Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy. Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media. Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information. ""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said. For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor. So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest. China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said. Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth. China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems. Reports said theBurmese military groundedseveral of its JF-17 fighter jets – jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 – due to technical malfunctions. TheNigerian military reported several technical problemswith the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets. Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan. In2019, during a brief air battlebetween the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later. India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim. Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media. The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise. One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi. Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets. The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system. ""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out. Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"". In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel. Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting. But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.

304761,Spain clamps down on Airbnb as tourism backlash returns for summer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wdd8lg581o,"The Spanish government has called for the removal of the listings of nearly 66,000 properties on rental platform Airbnb on the grounds that they breach regulations for tourist accommodation. The clampdown comes as protests against over-tourism have begun ahead of the summer season. Demonstrations in the Canary Islands on Sunday attracted thousands of people. The minister for social rights, consumer affairs and the 2030 Agenda, Pablo Bustinduy, said the rental properties in question had ""violated various norms regarding housing for tourist use"". The announcement followed a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must immediately withdraw from the market 4,984 of the properties cited by the ministry. The properties are in six regions: Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands. Bustinduy's ministry is now awaiting further judicial rulings on the other 60,000 or so properties whose listings it deems unlawful. According to the ministry, the properties it has identified either did not provide a licence number, provided an erroneous number, or did not specify the legal status of the owner to show whether they were renting on a professional basis or as a private individual. He described the court's decision as ""a clear victory for those who fight to protect the right to housing"". Bustinduy added that ""it can be possible to ensure that no economic interest has priority over housing and that no company, however big or powerful, is above the law"". Housing has emerged as Spaniards' biggest concern in recent months, due to spiralling rental costs, particularly in larger towns and cities. Read more:Spanish fightback against record tourism The cost of an average rental has doubled over the last decade, while salaries have failed to keep up. Tourist apartments have been identified by many as a major cause of the problem, depriving local residents of accommodation. Spain is the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, with 94 million foreign visitors in 2024, a 13% rise on the previous year. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said earlier this year ""there are too many Airbnbs and not enough homes"", and he promised to prevent the ""uncontrolled"" expansion of the use of properties for tourism. Some local governments have also started to act against Airbnb. Barcelona City Hall has said it will eliminate its 10,000 short-term tourist apartmentsby the end of 2028. Others have taken a different approach. In recent months, Airbnb has reached agreements with local authorities in the Canary Islands, Ibiza and Murcia aimed at ensuring property owners comply with tourist rental rules. Airbnb responded to the court ruling and Bustinduy's announcement by insisting it would appeal against decisions linked to this case and that no evidence of rule-breaking by hosts had been provided. It also cited a 2022 ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court which found that the responsibility for listing information lay with the host of each property, not the company, which was a ""neutral intermediary"" and not a real estate provider. The firm also made a broader point about the Spanish housing problem. ""The root cause of the affordable housing crisis in Spain is a lack of supply to meet demand,"" said a spokesperson. ""Governments across the world are seeing that regulating Airbnb does not alleviate housing concerns or return homes to the market – it only hurts local families who rely on hosting to afford their homes and rising costs."" Last summer, Spain saw a wave of protests against over-tourism in many popular destinations, with its impact on housing the biggest grievance. With the number of foreign visitors to Spain fast approaching 100 million per year, the unrest is expected to continue this summer. On Sunday, several thousand people took to the streets across the Canary Islands under the slogan ""Canaries have a limit"". In Majorca, a group calledMenys Turisme, Més Vida(Less tourism, more life) is preparing for similar actions, with a protest scheduled for 15 June. Pedro Sánchez warns against ""double standards"" after Russia was banned from the song contest in 2022. The short rental firm says it is aiming to offer a wider range of experiences for travellers.

198692,No clear answer on when Brits can use EU e-gates,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7zzgdz3jgo,"It remains unclear whether UK passport holders will be able to use e-gates at EU airports this summer. The EU Commission has told the BBC that UK citizens will not have access to them until a new scheme to enhance border security comes into force in October, and even then it is up to individual countries. When asked if e-gates would be available this summer, the prime minister's official spokesperson said it was up to individual nations to implement the changes and it would update on ""the precise timelines for that... in due course."" Since the UK left the EU bloc, many popular holiday destinations have seen long queues of British travellers at airports as they wait for passports to be checked. The new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) gathers biometric data on citizens arriving in the EU from non-member, third-party countries, which includes the UK. After technology delays, it is now due to roll out in October 2025. Monday's deal between the UK and the EUsays there will be ""no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)"". An EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES will open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders. ""Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system."" However, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said it was ""highly unlikely"" passport holders would be able to use EU e-gates this summer. ""The EU is introducing this new entry and exit scheme so nothing is going to happen before that's in place, and that's not yet in place. They've put the date back for that a few times, the latest date is the autumn, let's see if that's stuck to. ""After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment."" Some EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer. The inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October. Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said: ""This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch."" Currently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp. The new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp. The launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station. A youth visa scheme and how much the UK will contribute financially are among issues still being negotiated A food producer has said the new UK-EU deal will reduce paperwork for exporting goods. The deal covers defence, trade, fishing, and a possible youth scheme, in the first big reset since Brexit. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve.

333915,Jurassic snark: New Zealand dinosaur sculpture fuels debate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g77x1m9mno,"Some have called it an ""eyesaur"". Many more have described it as ""fabulous"". But one word Boom Boom, a seven-metre tall stainless steel dinosaur sculpture in New Zealand, could never be associated with is ""boring"". Just days after the sauropod statue was installed in Taupō Sculpture Park, in the scenic centre of New Zealand's North Island, Boom Boom has already prompted heated debate among locals. The artist - and the team that commissioned it - say that's exactly the point. The mirror-finish sculpture was commissioned by the Taupō Sculpture Trust and created by Slovenian-born artist Gregor Kregar. Kregar said that he wasn't ""particularly surprised"" by the furore that quickly surrounded his work. ""Sculpture sometimes stops people from their everyday interactions with the world,"" he told the BBC from his home in Auckland. ""It's really hard to hate a sculpture of a dinosaur."" Still, public opinion on Boom Boom is split. ""Fantastic! Getting people talking about art. Broadening the conversation,"" said one commenter on a social media post announcing Boom Boom's arrival. But another wrote: ""Public investment of $100,000 from the local ratepayers, many of who would have rather seen the money spent elsewhere in the community."" Funding for Boom Boom was finalised in 2018, before recent hikes in Taupō District Council's rate which is similar to a council tax. After several years of negotiations, the work was completed and installed in the park last week. Others still criticised the work as having no connection with Taupō, named New Zealand's most beautiful town in the 2023 Keep New Zealand Beautiful Awards. But Kregar said the rock that the dinosaur stands on is inspired by the volcanic history of the area. Lake Taupō, from which the town takes its name, is a large caldera, a volcano that has collapsed in on itself. It last erupted around 1,800 years ago. Sauropods, the inspiration for Boom Boom, are one of a few species of dinosaurs that paleontologists say lived in New Zealand. They became extinct 66 million years ago, along with most other non-avian dinosaurs. Kregar says the spirited debate around the sculpture means Boom Boom could eventually win round ""the haters"". ""You put the sculpture out there, there is reaction, people start falling in love with it, and then it becomes something that they start embracing, part of the local identity,"" he said. Kim Gillies, secretary of the Taupō Sculpture Trust, told the BBC that the decision to commission Boom Boom was not taken ""lightly"", but that it was chosen because ""it would help put Taupō on the map"". Gillies added that when it comes to the art, ""safe is a bit boring, right?"" No bones about it. Jason Wilsher-Mills' work explored his disability through theatrical portraits and sculptures. A new festival aims to explore the history and culture of the Devon moor's landscape, bosses say. Reading Gaol, which once held Oscar Wilde, has been empty for 11 years. A month-long scheme will coincide with the sculptures' arrival in Newton Aycliffe, police say. School shirts are transformed into works of art in order to raise awareness of knife crime.

193088,Who are the winners and losers from the UK-EU agreement?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz63d82z785o,"A deal to ""reset"" relations between the UK and the EU following Brexit has been agreed at a summit in London. The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU. BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers. Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU – including food products – have faced new checks and extra paperwork. Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules. UK food exports to the EU have fallen– with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 – and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape. Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers. If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats. Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023were worth £14bn, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales. But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards – a system known as ""dynamic alignment"" – and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area. The UK will also have to make a financial contribution. However it is currently unknown how much this will be and when it will be required. Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy -just 0.04% of GDP in 2024- it is politically sensitive. The ""reset"" document notes ""political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038"" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected. Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets. Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: ""This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement."" She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be ""no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters"" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products. In 2023, the UKexported £1.2bn of fish to the EU, around 70% of all fish exports. Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would ""speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market"". Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30. However, the impact of what is being called a ""youth experience scheme"" could be uneven. Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way. And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. ""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,"" she said. Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer. The government claims: ""British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control."" However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the ""potential use of eGates where appropriate"". It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify. Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October. EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders. Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says. Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with €150bn (£126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm. This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK. The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directlyemploys about164,00 peoplein the UK. Between 2020 and 2024, the UK wasestimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Instituteto have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter. Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? A food producer has said the new UK-EU deal will reduce paperwork for exporting goods. Hull City Council says 80% of the 136 graduates secured jobs within a month. With its powerful beak and venom, this predator is laying waste to crabs and lobsters. For the people who risk life and limb going to sea - the deal is another huge disappointment. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. Copyright 2025 BBC.

867263,Huge challenges await new president of divided Romania,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3jxp72mv2o,"Imagine having a president called Nicky. That's what Romanians just voted for: a softly-spoken, slightly geeky mathematician who everyone refers to by his first name, Nicusor – or Nicky. On Monday, hours after claiming victory in the elections, the new president picked up his daughter from school as usual. He's promised his children nothing will change. But for Romania things looked very different this morning. Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades. But it was also the least extreme option for change. Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults. He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania. Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over. ""This time, fear managed to defeat fury,"" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout. ""Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards. ""It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power."" I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days. When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags. They tended to talk about God and the ""traditional values"" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU ""imposing"" same-sex marriage on Romania. Other voters are drawn to Simion's ""Romania first"" rhetoric and promises of a better life. ""Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,"" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples. She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be ""so corrupt"". So when the results came in she was disappointed. ""I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?"" Liliana shrugged. ""I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan."" George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a ""man of my people"". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes. Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections. Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having ""dictatorial tendencies"" and said the country was run by ""the ayatollahs"". ""It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,"" Diana thinks. ""It made me change my vote."" Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him ""autistic, poor guy"". ""Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,"" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote. ""I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that."" For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling. At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: ""Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!"" They were referring to allegations that Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu. When he came from nowhere to win the first round,the vote was annulled. This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day. But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia – he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin – was a turn-off for many voters. Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion. His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe. When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement. Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won. ""So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,"" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. ""I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU."" By contrast, Dan put relations with Europe at the heart of his campaign. ""It's better for the European way, for younger people and for Romania – because we get more EU funds, more development,"" another young voter, Catalin Petrosanu, approved. ""Also Nicusor is the smartest guy since the revolution. He knows how to do things."" In the end, Dan's win was emphatic. But millions of Romanian voters chose a different way, different values. While hopes for the 'change' candidate are high, the challenges are huge and patience may be limited. ""In my view, this is the last chance for the mainstream political class to win an election on a 'Save Europe, Save Democracy' platform,"" Radu Magdin warns. George Simion is just 38 and going nowhere; his nationalist AUR party are strong in parliament. ""Next time, it's 'bye bye' if these people do not do their job,"" the analyst says. ""Next time it could be somebody like Simion."" It is unclear whether UK travellers can avoid long queues this summer and use e-gates at European airports.

780658,Biden's cancer diagnosis raises fresh questions about his health in White House,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn0zm8d20o,"Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82 year old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms. Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, had not been detected earlier. Others pointed out that cancers can grow fast without the patient displaying symptoms - and that men over 70 are not routinely screened. President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday his predecessor should have been more transparent with the public, seeming to suggest - without offering evidence - that the cancer diagnosis had been covered up.  ""I think it is very sad actually. I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,"" Trump said at an event at the White House. ""It could take years to get to this level of danger. So, look, it's a very, very sad situation. I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened."" Biden has yet to respond to Trump's comments, which came amid reports that the Democrat's aides sought to conceal other deteriorating health conditions from the public ahead of the 2024 election.  Republicans claim that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. He dropped out of the race last summer after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office. The authors write: ""Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election."" The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election. ""It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,"" Senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday. After the news of Biden's diagnosis, Vice-President JD Vance wished him well but then asked whether Biden's doctors or staff members sought to keep the public from knowing about the true state of his health. ""This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,"" he added. Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who worked as a Covid adviser to the Biden White House, was among those claiming that Biden probably had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it. ""He did not develop in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president,"" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe show. ""He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that."" US medical guidelines do not recommend routine blood screenings for men over 70 because prostate cancers can be very slow-growing, and the harm of testing and treatment may outweigh the risk from the cancer.  Biden had previously been diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate. In 2019, before he was elected, his campaign released the report from his medical screening, saying he had been treated with medication and surgery, ""and has never had prostate cancer"". That's led to questions about whether Biden was tested at any point during his four-year presidency - and why the diagnosis came so late. ""I would assume the former president gets a very thorough physical every year,"" Dr Chris George of the Northwestern Health Network told Reuters. ""It's sort of hard for me to believe that he's had a (blood test) within the past year that was normal."" However, Dr Robert Figlin, interim director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer, told the BBC that the aggressive way Biden's cancer had presented was not that unusual. And he warned critics against ""assuming that somehow something was missed along the way"". Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer for men, according to the Cleveland Clinic. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), out of every 100 American men, 13 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, and two or three men will die from it. Russ Penwell, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 28, tells men to check themselves. The former US president has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office says. The disease has spread to the 82-year-old's bones but his office said the cancer could be effectively managed. Éanna Mac Cana documents his connection with Fermanagh's Dr Denis Burkitt after his rare cancer diagnosis. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men in the US.

977920,Seven Mexican youths shot dead at church festivity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v55r93053o,"Seven Mexican youths have been shot dead at a festivity organised by the Catholic Church in the central state of Guanajuato. Gunmen opened fire on a group of people who had stayed behind in the central square of the village of San Bartolo de Berrios after an event organised by the local parish. Eyewitnesses said the assailants had driven straight to the village square in the early hours of Monday and fired dozens of shots seemingly at random. The authorities have not yet said what the motive behind the shooting may have been but messages scrawled on signs left at several nearby locations appear to indicate it was carried out by the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel.  While attacks on nightclubs, bars and cockfighting venues are not unusual in Mexican states hit by cartel violence, an attack on an event organised by the Catholic Church is rare. The Episcopal Conference of Mexico, which represents the country's bishops, condemned the fatal shooting saying it ""cannot remain indifferent in the face of the spiral of violence that is wounding so many communities"". The local archbishop, Jaime Calderón, also released a statement blaming the attack on a fight for territory between rival cartels. Guanajuato, where San Bartolo de Berrios is located, had the highest number of murders of any state in Mexico in 2024 with a total of 2,597 homicides. Both the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel are active in the state and have been locked in a deadly battle for control over territory. While the two groups engage in extortion and drug trafficking, they have also  increasingly tapped pipelines which run through the state carrying petrol from refineries to major distribution points. The practice of stealing and selling fuel on the black market - known ashuachicoleo- is a major source of revenue for the criminal gangs in the region. In their fight for territorial control, the gangs often try to spread fear amid the local population in order to ensure their silence and compliance. Bloody shootings such as the one in San Bartolo de Berrios and the subsequent display of threatening messages are a particularly brutal way gangs use to show they have expanded into a particular town. Residents of San Bartolo de Berrios said they had heard around 100 shots ring out in the early hours of Monday within the space of a few minutes. They said the scene in the central square resembled ""a bloodbath"" with the bodies of the seven youths, two of them aged under 18, strewn across the pavement. No arrests have so far been made in connection with the attack.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

67897,"Four sticking points in Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jxn8m88ro,"US President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is one step closer to a full vote in the House of Representatives. The 1,116-page bill - officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - was approved 17-16 by the budget committee on Sunday night. And on Tuesday, he is headed to Capitol Hill to persuade Republicans to back it. Trump wants to get dissenting Republicans, of whom there are four, to support it. Those four Republican dissidents voted ""present"" rather than against the legislation in Sunday's procedural vote, giving House Speaker Mike Johnson a rare win. But last week, in an initial vote, the hold-outs voted ""no"" to the bill, citing concerns that its spending cuts were not deep enough to reduce the US national debt. The Senate must also pass the legislation and Republicans in that chamber are planning their own tweaks. Let's take a look at where the disagreements lie. Among the primary sticking points in the negotiations is just how much to slash from the bill. As things stand, the measure's tax breaks total about $4.9tr (£3.7tn), partly paid for by cuts to the healthcare programme known as Medicaid, as well as to green energy tax breaks approved by former President Joe Biden. Four right-wing lawmakers withheld their support, arguing that the cuts should be steeper to avoid swelling America's public debt, which currently stands at $36tr. A fifth lawmaker also voted no, citing procedural reasons. ""The bill does not yet meet the moment,""  one of the rebels, Texas Republican Chip Roy, posted on social media late on Sunday. ""We can and must do better before we pass the final product."" Perhaps the most contentious item in the bill are cuts - partly through work requirements - to Medicaid, a healthcare programme aimed at lower-income Americans. Roy and other Republicans - including South Carolina's Ralph Norman, Oklahoma's Josh Brecheen and Georgia's Andrew Clyde - want further cuts to Medicaid and other social security programmes. On Sunday night, Speaker Johnson said ""minor modifications"" had been promised to the four rebels. Norman said these concessions include making the Medicaid work requirements take effect sooner, preventing undocumented immigrants from accessing Medicaid and ditching green energy tax credits. The bill currently would require that states deny Medicaid coverage if able-bodied Americans using the programme are not working at least 80 hours a month or undertaking other community options - from 2029, after Trump has left office. It would also end coverage for those who cannot show they are meeting work requirements. Roy and other conservatives want those work requirements to start straightaway - rather than after President Trump has left office. Other lawmakers, such as Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley, have argued against any cuts to Medicaid, warning it would affect millions of lower-income constituents. Hawley wrote in the New York Times that such a move would be ""both morally wrong and politically suicidal"". Dozens of other House Republicans have also voiced concerns. Another point of contention in the bill is a tripling of a local tax deduction - known as Salt - from $10,000 to $30,000 for couples. Some lawmakers from states with high taxes such as New York, California and New Jersey have objected, saying that the proposed cap is not high enough. In a joint statement earlier in May, New York Republican Congress members Elise Stefanik, Andrew Garbarino, Nick LaLota and Mike Lawler said Speaker Johnson's offer was too low and "" insulting"". Some so-called Salt Republicans want the cap raised to $62,000 for individuals and double for couples filing jointly. House Republican leaders are reportedly seeking a compromise that would see the cap raised to $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for joint filers. The ""Salt Caucus"" formed in 2021 is a bipartisan effort that brings together both Democrats and Republicans who hope to repeal the current $10,000 cap. As part of the bill, House Republicans have called for substantial reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme, or Snap. More than 42 million Americans currently benefit from the Snap programme, which allows them to use federal funds to buy groceries every year. The legislation would require individual states to shoulder 5% of the benefit's costs each year, as well as 75% of the administrative costs. At the moment, states are not responsible for Snap costs and pay half of the administrative costs. Republicans also hope to expand existing work requirements for recipients, which currently apply to people without dependants between the ages of 18 and 54. The current proposal would expand that to 64. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said the proposal ""is a slap in the face"" to millions of Americans ""who rely on food assistance programme to put food on the table and make sure their kids don't go hungry"". Republicans argue the proposal would reduce government waste, promote work over welfare, and restore ""common sense"" to the programme. The House Agriculture Committee has already approved $300m in cuts to the Snap programme to fund tax cuts. Government data shows that about 12% of Americans received Snap benefits last year, with the figure higher in some Republican-leaning states such as Alabama and Oklahoma. The billionaire, who spent $250m to help Trump win election, says he feels he has ""done enough"". A scuffle broke out during a visit by Democratic lawmakers, but LaMonica McIver says the case against her is political. The news that he has ""aggressive"" prostate cancer has some medics asking why it was not detected sooner. It follows Donald Trump saying Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately"" start negotiating, after a two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin. ""We don't think it will lead to any outcome,"" the supreme leader warns, saying the US is making ""outrageous"" demands on uranium enrichment. Copyright 2025 BBC.

221667,UK sanctions 'godmother' of Israel's settler movement Daniella Weiss,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7066e7z9k4o,"The UK government has announced sanctions on Daniella Weiss, a far-right Israeli settler known as the ""godmother"" of the settler movement. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move ""demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account as Palestinian communities suffer violence and intimidation"". Weiss, 79, is the leader of a radical settler organisation called Nachala - or homeland - which has also been sanctioned. For decades, Weiss has been prominent in the founding of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. In the sanctions sheet, she was described as having been involved in ""threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting, acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals"". An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson described the sanctions - which also target two other settlers, two illegal settler outposts, and two organisations - as ""unjustified, and regrettable"". Weiss was recently featured in Louis Theroux's documentary ""The Settlers"" - and has been active in the movement to rebuild settlements in Gaza. Speakingto BBC News last year,she said: ""Gaza Arabs will not stay in the Gaza Strip. Who will stay? Jews."" ""The world is wide,"" she added. ""Africa is big. Canada is big. The world will absorb the people of Gaza. How we do it? We encourage it. Palestinians in Gaza, the good ones, will be enabled. I'm not saying forced, I say enabled because they want to go."" In response to the sanctions, Weiss said hundreds of families ""are prepared and ready to implement settlement in Gaza - immediately"". Nachala called for ""conquest, immigration and settlement in Gaza"" and adding that it wants Israel to ""continue the war until the enemy is destroyed"". The UK also announced sanctions on two other settlers - Zohar Sabah and Harel David Libi, as well as the outposts Coco's Farm, and Neria's Farm, and the organisation Libi Construction and Infrastructure LTD. Outposts are settlements built without official Israeli authorisation. ""The Israeli government has a responsibility to intervene and halt these aggressive actions. Their consistent failure to act is putting Palestinian communities and the two-state solution in peril,"" Lammy added. Additionally, the UK government announced it would pause free trade negotiations with Israel with immediate effect, saying ""it is not possible to advance discussions"" with ""a Netanyahu government that is pursuing egregious policies in the West Bank and Gaza"". An Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson responded: ""If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy — that is its own prerogative."" The move follows a strongly-worded joint-statement from the leaders of the UK, France and Canada on Monday whichcalled on the Israeli governmentto ""stop its military operations"" and ""immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza"". Israel has said it will allow a ""basic amount of food"" into Gaza, ending an 11-week blockade of the territory, which it said was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release remaining hostages. But United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said the amount of aid was a ""drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"". Tzeela Gez died from her injuries, but doctors were able to deliver her baby. Israeli settler Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'  in occupied West Bank Jumaa Zawayda didn't know if his home was among those destroyed after Israel ordered thousands to evacuate Jenin. Dozens of countries will give evidence at the ICJ hearings, which Israel has labelled a ""circus"".

1017616,Elon Musk signals plans to dial back political spending,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nnx11v5lo,"Billionaire Elon Musk has said he expects to dial back his political donations, a major shift from the figure who shook up the 2024 election as a top donor to President Donald Trump. Musk, who ultimately spent more than $250m (£187m) in support of Trump's election effort, told an economic conference in Qatar that he planned to do ""a lot less"" spending in the future. He also said he intended to stay on as the head of electric car company Tesla for another five years. After helping Trump achieve victory, Musk led the White House effort to slash federal spending, commonly called Doge. Under pressure from Tesla investors concerned, he has recently scaled back his Washington work.  Those  investors and board members were concerned that Doge was consuming his attention, while also alienating some customers. Asked about his plans for spending in next year's US congressional elections, Musk said he felt he had ""done enough"". ""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason,"" he added. Musk's political spending since November has not been as fruitful. He and groups he backs put more than $20 million behind the Republican candidate who lost the election to be a justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year. Government-funded welfare programmes have become a major point of contention in Trump's tax bill. It squeaked through a key commitee but faces more challenges before the whole chamber will vote on it. The disease has spread to the 82-year-old's bones but his office said the cancer could be effectively managed. Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has defined himself by his persistence and endurance.

195714,French police launch prison hunt for mini Chinese-made phones,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv11qvq397o,"French authorities have launched a nationwide hunt for thousands of tiny Chinese-made telephones used by convicts to continue criminal activities from inside prison. The telephones, no bigger than a cigarette-lighter, are almost entirely plastic, and have a reputation for being virtually invisible to metal detectors. Under Operation Prison Break, announced on Tuesday by the cyber crime branch of the Paris prosecutor's office, prison officers have been authorised to conduct searches in 500 cells in 66 detention centres. According to Le Monde newspaper, the devices were nicknamed ""suppositories"" by prison inmates because of their ease of concealment. ""Investigations have established that some of these telephones were used to commit crimes from inside detention, including drugs trafficking, racketeering,  arson and attempted murder,"" a statement from the prosecutor's office said. The French supplier of the devices – a company called Oportik – has been stopped from trading and three staff members arrested.  It is believed to have sold about 5,000 of the phones, the cheapest of which cost just €20 (£16.84). France's Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin has pledged to crack down on drug gangs and other criminal organisations, whose leaders he said are too often able to continue to conduct operating even after being jailed. In 2024 some 40,000 mobile phones were confiscated in prisons. Conventional devices are projected over prison walls or dropped by drones. Others are smuggled in by corrupt prison staff.  Phone-jamming is deployed in some jails, but there are doubts about its efficacity. Similar mini-phones are manufactured in large numbers in China, according to Le Monde. While they are themselves perfectly legal in France, it is a crime to supply a prisoner with a phone. The French prosecutor's office said it had passed information on how it traced the Oportik phones to the EU's judicial cooperation agency Eurojust, so that other countries can conduct similar clampdowns.

1027943,"At least 38 killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza in half-hour period, medics say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy67y8834yo,"At least 38 Palestinians were killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip during a half-hour period overnight, according to Palestinian medics. Israeli warplanes struck several locations, including a school in eastern Gaza City, and an abandoned fuel station sheltering displaced families in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Hamas-run civil defence agency. It added that rescue teams were facing major difficulties reaching the wounded due to a lack of equipment and the intensity of the bombardment. The attack comes after Israel issued a sweeping evacuation order for civilians in Gaza in preparation for what it said was an""unprecedented attack"". Ten people were killed when an Israeli air strike hit classrooms at the Musa bin Nusayr School, where hundreds of displaced people were sheltering, according to local activists in Gaza City. In central Gaza, 15 people were reported killed in a strike targeting tents at an abandoned fuel station in Nuseirat. Meanwhile, local journalists said 13 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on the Abu Samra family's three-story home in central Deir al-Balah. Separately, Israeli jets launched 10 air strikes on the Shujaiya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City. Local reports described the blasts as causing tremors similar to an earthquake. The strikes are believed to have targeted Hamas's network of underground tunnels. The attack comes as the leaders of the UK, France and Canadaissued a joint statement threatening actionif Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persisted with his goal to ""take control"" of all of Gaza. Netanyahu described the statement as a ""huge prize"" for Hamas. Earlier, Israel said it would allow a""basic amount"" of foodinto Gaza, ending an 11-week blockade of the territory. But United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said the amount of aid was a ""drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"". The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage. Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. At least 53,486 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according the Hamas-run health ministry. The UK, France and Canada ""strongly oppose"" Benjamin Netanyahu's expansion of military operations, a statement from their leaders said. The UN's humanitarian chief welcomes the move but says it is only ""a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"".

285139,"Jeremy Bowen: Goodwill running out as UK, France and Canada demand Israel end Gaza offensive",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9j1052p2yo,"Israel went to war after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 armed with an arsenal of weapons mostly paid for, supplied and then resupplied by the United States. Its other allies gave Israel something just as potent in its own way: a deep credit of goodwill and solidarity, based on revulsion at the killings of 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and the sight of 251 people being dragged into captivity in Gaza as hostages. Now it seems that Israel's credit has gone, at least as far as France, the United Kingdom and Canada are concerned. They have issued their strongest condemnation yet of the way Israel is fighting the war in Gaza. Israel, they say, must halt its new offensive, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will destroy Hamas, rescue the remaining hostages and put all of Gaza under direct Israeli military control. Their statement dismisses Netanyahu's arguments and calls for a ceasefire. Together, the three governments say that they ""strongly oppose the expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza"" adding: ""The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable."" They call for the release of the remaining hostages and recall that after the ""heinous attack"" on 7 October they believed that the Israeli state ""had a right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate"". Netanyahu's decision to allow what he called ""minimal"" food into Gaza was they said ""wholly inadequate"". Netanyahu has hit back, saying the ""leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities"". He insisted the war could end if Hamas returned hostages, laid down its arms, agreed for its leaders to go into exile and Gaza was demilitarised. ""No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't,"" he said. Netanyahu - who is sought under an International criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he has dismissed as ""antisemitic"" - had been under heavy international pressure to end the blockade of Gaza after a respected international survey warned of imminent famine. At the London summit between the EU and the UK the President of the European Council, António Costa, called the humanitarian crisis in Gaza ""a tragedy where international law is being systematically violated, and an entire population is being subjected to disproportionate military force"". ""There must be safe, swift and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid,"" he said. Netanyahu's reluctant decision to allow in limited supplies was condemned by his ultra nationalist coalition partners. The Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, convicted in 2007 for incitement to racism and supporting an extremist Jewish group that Israel classifies as a terrorist organisation, complained that Netanyahu's decision would ""fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels"". Only five trucks made it into Gaza on Monday, as Israeli troops advanced and air and artillery strikes killed more Palestinian civilians including many young children. Opponents of Israel's destruction of Gaza and the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians will say the governments of France, the UK and Canada are speaking out far too late. Many of them have held months of demonstrations protesting about the death and destruction in Gaza – and more killing of Palestinian civilians and confiscation of land in the West Bank, the other side of the Palestinian territories, during military operations and raids by armed Jewish settlers. But sometimes in the politics of war, a single incident carries symbolic power that clarifies and crystallises so sharply that it can force governments to action. This time it was the killing on 23 March by Israeli forces in Gaza of 15 paramedics and aid workers. It came after Israel, on 18 March, had broken a ceasefire that had held for two months with a series of massive air strikes. Five days into the renewed war an Israeli unit attacked the medical convoy, and covered the men they had killed and their bullet ridden vehicles with the sand. The Israeli account of what happened was shown to be untrue when a mobile phone was recovered from a body in the mass grave. Its owner had filmed the incident before he was killed. Far from proving Israel's claim that the emergency workers were a potential threat to the Israeli combat soldiers, the video from the grave showed that clearly marked and well-lit ambulances and emergency vehicles were attacked systematically until almost everyone inside them was killed. Alarm has been growing fast since then, not just among Israel's usual opponents. Its European allies, with President Macron of France leading the way, have been toughening their language. The statement calling for an end to Israel's offensive is their harshest criticism of Israel so far. A senior European diplomatic source involved in their discussions told me that the tough language reflected a ""real sense of growing political anger at the humanitarian situation, of a line being crossed, and of this Israeli government appearing to act with impunity"". More ominously for Israel, the statement says that ""we will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete steps in response"". They do not specify what those might be. Sanctions could be one possibility. A bigger step would be to recognise Palestine as an independent state. France has been considering joining the 148 other states that have done so at a conference it is co-chairing with Saudi Arabia in New York in early June. The UK has also talked about Palestinian recognition with the French. Israel, pushing back hard, has told them they would be presenting Hamas with a victory. But the tone of the statement made by the French, the Canadians and the British suggests that Israel is losing its ability to pressurise them. Foreign Secretary David Lammy summons the Israeli ambassador suspends talks on a trade deal. About 14,000 babies will die in 48 hours if aid does not reach them, a UN humanitarian chief warns. Fighter jets hit sites including a school in Gaza City, the Hamas-run civil defence agency says.

654799,Zelensky accuses Russia of 'buying time' to stall truce talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgddel17kvo,"Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of ""trying to buy time"" to continue its war in Ukraine, a day after Donald Trump said progress towards a ceasefire had been made in a call with Vladimir Putin. ""If Russia continues to put forward unrealistic conditions and undermine progress, there must be tough consequences,"" Ukraine's president wrote on social media, adding that Kyiv was ready to negotiate. Following separate calls with Zelensky and Putin on Monday, Trump said truce talks between Russia and Ukraine would start ""immediately"". Putin said he was ready to work on a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"", but did not address calls for a 30-day pause in fighting. On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was up to Kyiv to ""make decisions"" and respond to a proposed peace memorandum. However, the Kremlin downplayed suggestions that negotiations were close, with Russian state news agencies citing spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying ""there are no deadlines and there cannot be any"". Meanwhile, Zelensky launched a fresh round of diplomacy, speaking to Western allies in a bid to shore up support. Following a phone call with the Finnish president, Zelensky wrote on social media that Ukraine was working with partners to ensure pressure on Moscow ""forces the Russians to change their behaviour"". It came as the European Union and UK announced that they had adopted new rounds of sanctions against Russia. The EU said it was blacklisting nearly 200 more oil tankers in Russia's ""shadow fleet"", and warned of a ""tougher response"" if Moscow did not agree to a truce in Ukraine. The UK placed sanctions 18 more tankers, as part of its package targeting Russian military suppliers, energy exports and financial institutions. It followed a record drone assault in Ukraine over the weekend, which Kyiv officials described as the largest since the start of the full-scale invasion. On Monday, Trump indicated he would not join in any new sanctions on Russia, telling reporters that they could hinder recent progress. It came as heavy fighting continued along the front line, with Ukraine reporting 177 clashes and claiming over 1,000 Russian casualties in 24 hours. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU ministers on Tuesday, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russia's continued attacks ""speak louder than the lip service we have heard for so long"". ""Putin is clearly playing for time. Unfortunately, we have to say he is not really interested in peace,"" he said. Putin has so far rebuffed a joint US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and last week rejected Zelensky's invitation to meet for talks in Istanbul. Trump had offered to attend the talks if Putin would be there, but the Russian leader declined. The Kremlin has previously announced temporary ceasefires, including from 8-11 Mayto coincide with Russia's Second World War victory celebrations. Kyiv refused to join, citing mistrust and demanding an immediate, sustained cessation of hostilities. A similar 30-hour truce over Easter saw a brief lull in fighting, though both sides accused each other of hundreds of violations. Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A scuffle broke out during a visit by Democratic lawmakers, but LaMonica McIver says the case against her is political.

741961,Post Office data breach victims to get compensation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje7wnd3j57o,"The Post Office has agreed compensationfor hundreds of former sub-postmasters after accidentally leaking their names and addresses on its corporate website. The data breach was revealed in June last yearwhen it emerged the personal details of 555 victims of the Horizon IT scandal had been published. The company has now confirmed individual payouts of up to £5,000 with the potential for higher sums for those who want to pursue a further claim. The Post Office has already apologised and said it was working in ""full co-operation"" with the Information Commissioner's Office. The sub-postmasters' details were published in a document on its website. At the time, then-Post Office chief executive Nick Read said the leak was a ""truly terrible error"". The law firm Freeths, which acted for the 555 sub-postmasters when they sued the Post Office in a landmark High Court case in 2017, said it had secured the payouts on behalf of all those affected and their legal representatives. Of the 420 victims Freeths represents in the ongoing and separate battle for compensation from the scandal, 348 have already received payoutsfor the breach. Former sub-postmaster Chris Head welcomed the Post Office admitting the data breach mistake, but said they took ""far too long to right this wrong"". ""We cannot underestimate the level of pain, anxiety, stress and worry that so many people have had to suffer through this new episode. Post Office did not seem to understand how much this impacted those people. They appeared unwilling to engage in genuine discussions until further action was on the table. ""The impact on myself and my family has been profound on top of an already traumatic past 10 years due to the Horizon scandal."" The Post Office said victims would be paid either £5,000 or £3,500, depending on whether the individual was also living at the address at the time. In a statement it also confirmed it would consider any special cases if individuals believe they are entitled to further amounts. ""We have written to all named individuals either directly, or via their solicitors. If there are any individuals whose name was impacted by last year's breach, but who have not received information about the payment for some reason, they can contact us or ask their solicitors if they have legal representation,"" it said. The lawyer who led the case on behalf of the sub-postmasters said the agreement was struck without the need for any claims to be submitted but also allowed victims the opportunity to pursue further action. ""We welcome the progress we have made with this case but there is still a long way to go to recognise the devastating impact of this breach for those affected,"" said Will Richmond-Coggan, Freeths' partner specialising in data breach litigation. Former sub-postmaster Bob Stevenson says he lost his home and business in the Horizon scandal. Newcastle Building Society says it has provided funds to Philips Trust Corporation's administrators. Not owning crucial code has meant it has been unable to replace the system that led to a scandal. A councillor says the organisation needs to ""get their fingers out"" to sort a replacement quickly.

798159,Five unanswered questions in UK-EU deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz2jegmm3o,"The UK and the European Union have agreed a major new deal covering areas including trade, defence, fishing and energy. However, negotiations are still taking place on a number of key issues - leaving some important questions unanswered. The deal makes several references to a ""financial contribution"" from the UK to access certain benefits, notably an agreement to reduce checks on food exports to the EU. The prime minister's official spokesman said these were ""administrative costs"". He insisted they would not be ""big"" but refused to put a figure on how much the UK would pay. In other areas, terms are still being negotiated so the cost to the UK isn't known yet. For example, the two sides are working towards the UK rejoining the Erasmus+ exchange programme, which allows students to study or do work placements abroad. Rather than simply covering administrative costs, the UK would be expecting to get direct benefits in return and the government has said it will only take part ""on significantly improved financial terms"". The UK has agreed to work towards a ""youth experience scheme"" with the EU, which would allow young people from the bloc to apply for a visa to live and work in the UK and vice versa. The government has said any such deal would be ""capped and time-limited"" but it has not specified how many visas could be issued annually and how long they would be valid for. These details will be the subject of future negotiations. The UK already has similar schemes with 11 countries including Australia, New Zealand and Japan, with people able to stay for up to three years depending on which country they are from. Last year, just over 24,000 youth mobility visas were issued by the UK. Since Brexit, British travellers at EU airports have generally been forced to have their passport stamped at manned desks, rather than use automatic gates with facial recognition technology. Some airports already allow British passport-holders to use e-gates - but for those that don't, the only alternative is often a lengthy queue. The deal states that there will be ""no legal barriers"" to Britons using e-gates when travelling to and from EU countriesafter the introduction of the European Union Entry/Exit System. The long-awaited digital border checks system is due to replace passport stamping for travellers from outside the EU in October. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants UK holidaymakers to be able to use e-gates ""as soon as possible"". Asked whether this could happen this summer, his spokesman said: ""we will certainly be working on that basis"". But it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport holders can use e-gates at their airports. The European Commission confirmed British nationals would be able to use e-gates once the Entry/Exit system is in place, provided they are registered with the system. But it's still not clear whether this will be possible in more airports before October, when the system is due to be launched. Since Brexit, British musicians have faced extra costs and red tape when touring Europe -and stars have long called for action to tackle this. Labour's general election manifesto last year pledged to ""help our touring artists"" as part of negotiations with the EU. But the deal agreed on Monday only recognises the ""value"" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts ""to support travel and cultural exchange"". The UK says it will explore ""how best to improve arrangements for touring across the European continent"". Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed this as ""an important first step"" but said the sector was seeking ""more concrete commitments"". Another promise in Labour's manifesto was to ""secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications to help open up markets for UK service exporters"". This would mean professionals - such as doctors, lawyers, accountants and architects - who qualified in one country could practice in another with minimal extra bureaucracy. EU citizens already have the right to do this across the bloc. Such an agreement would make it easier for British companies to move staff between the UK and EU and undertake short-term work in Europe. However, there may be less incentive for the EU to reach a deal on this, given that the current situation makes it harder for UK firms to compete for business in Europe. Monday's deal only promises to set up ""dedicated dialogues"" on the recognition of professional qualifications. A full agreement in this area could take much longer to negotiate, if the EU will sign up to one at all.

223097,Police probe gang feud links to targeted attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygg3nevz7o,"Police are investigating possible links between a targeted attack at an East Kilbride garage and an ongoing gangland feud. Three men wearing dark clothes and face coverings are believed to have carried out the assault, which took place around 13:25 on Monday at Wilson Place. Two men, aged 45 and 41, were taken to hospital for treatmentfollowing the attack. Police stated a blue Audi A5, found on fire in Blantyre on Monday evening, was likely to have been used during the earlier assault. A series of assaults, shootings and firebombing incidents in Glasgow and Edinburghhave taken place since March, linked to rival groups targeting one another. BBC Scotland News understands the force are exploring gangland links to the East Kilbride assault as a line of inquiry, while also determining the weapons used. Det Supt Martin McGhee said: ""We believe this was a targeted incident. From our enquiries so far, we believe the car that was set on fire was also used in the earlier serious assault. ""We understand these incidents will be concerning for the local community but please be assured we will bring those involved to justice."" Det Supt McGhee appealed for any witnesses tocontact the force. Policehave made more than 30 arrestsin connection with the crimes since they began in March. Copyright 2025 BBC.

735498,Family criticises law change on paedophiles' parental rights,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr8v24g6gxo,"A family who went to court to protect a young girl from her paedophile father have criticised government legislation intended to help others in a similar position. The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment which would remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles - but only if they have abused their own children. In 2023 the BBC reported on a mother whohad to spend more than £30,000to protect her small daughter. Her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, but kept parental responsibility over his own child. Her parents said they were ""very disappointed"". The government said it would continue work to make the law ""as strong as it needs to be"". Over many months in Cardiff Family Court I watched as a young woman, who we called ""Bethan"", brought a case to protect her young daughter. Although her ex-husband had been convicted of the most serious child sex offences, and was banned from contact with other children, he retained parental responsibility over his own child. That meant that he could have a say over her education, decisions about her health, and where she would live. He could also in future have contact with his daughter. In fact, he told the court from prison via a videolink, he was already writing letters every week to the little girl. He wasn't allowed to send them. At the end of the hearings, the judge granted the mother's application, removing the father's parental rights and barring him from all contact, including on social media, until the child turns 18. The family were pleased - but it had cost them over £30,000 in legal fees. Harriet Harman, who is now in the Lords but was then an MP, heard my report, and decided to try to change the law, to remove what she called this ""glaring anomaly"". Her amendment meant that after a criminal conviction for serious child sex offences, a parent would automatically lose their parental responsibility. Families like Bethan's would no longer need to go to the Family Court. In April 2024 the Conservative Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk supported this change for the most serious cases, where children had been raped. ""This new law will ensure they are automatically safeguarded against those whose despicable actions have shown them to utterly lack any nurturing and caring instincts,"" he said at the time. Bethan and her parents were delighted.  But the government called the July election - and the law didn't change. In the most recent King's Speech, in 2024, the Labour government promised to enact the change, saying it would restrict parental responsibility for child sex offenders. However, when the wording of the new law was published on 7 May it said that removing parental responsibility would only apply ""for a serious sexual offence committed against a child for whom the offender has parental responsibility"". In other words, where someone had abused their own child or stepchild. This would not cover Bethan's family. Bethan's parents said the government should go back to the bill that Harriet Harman had proposed, where the emphasis was on ""protecting innocent children"" rather than ""thinking about the rights of the paedophile"". The draft legislation - which will have its second reading in Parliament today - also says the restriction of parental responsibility should apply only where someone has been sentenced to at least four years in prison. The grandparents of Bethan's child believe it should apply more widely. ""Really what we're talking about here is where the line is drawn. And we obviously think that line should be drawn much lower down,"" the child's grandfather said. The grandmother said the court case had been a ""terrible stress"" for her daughter. ""What people don't realise is when you take on a family court case, it's like taking on a full time job because it takes hundreds of hours to get the information together,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Bethan had to take her child out of childcare, give up her flat, and ""use every bit of savings"" she had to pay for the family court, the child's grandmother added. Victims minister Alex Davies-Jones said in response: ""We are protecting children and ensuring victims are properly supported. ""These changes will, for the first time, introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility for offenders who sexually abuse their own child and receive a prison sentence of four years or more - removing the need for victims to go through court to secure this. ""I do recognise the concerns raised by victims and campaigners and will continue working closely with them to ensure the law is as strong and protective as it needs to be."" The changes follow an independent review into domestic murder sentencing by barrister Clare Wade. BBC Verify examines the different claims about how many farms will be affected by the inheritance tax changes for agricultural assets. The annual Private Members' Bill ballot is a chance for backbench MPs to create new legislation. Groups falling under the new definition will be barred from government funding and meeting officials.

775698,Bicester firefighter's bravery shone through - family,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3jjed70zeo,"The family of a firefighter who died in a blaze that claimed three lives have said her ""bravery and fearlessness shone through right until the end"". Firefighters Jennie Logan, 30, and Martyn Sadler, 38, along with father-of-two Dave Chester, 57, were killed in the blaze that engulfed the Bicester Motion site on Thursday evening. Two more firefighters remain in hospital in a stable condition after suffering serious injuries in the fire, which was brought under control.A police investigation has since been launched. In a statement released by Thames Valley Police, Ms Logan's family said she was a ""much loved daughter to us, her sister, Emilie, and 'Mum' to her beloved dog, Mouse"". Ms Logan owned a dog business and used toattend shows with her dog Mouse. ""We still can't believe we'll never see her again, driving around Bicester collecting her dogs, which were like a second family,"" the family statement continued. ""She found her calling three years ago when she joined the fire service where she could use her incredible strength and determination. ""Jennie was a force to be reckoned with but to everyone who knew her, she was such a loving, caring, thoughtful person, who would do anything and everything to help. ""She lived life at 100mph, juggling her business with her love for rugby, where she made some truly amazing friends. ""When Jennie's pager went off, there was no stopping her. The statement went on to say: ""Never did we think that when running out the door last Thursday, to give it her all, like she always did, it would be for the final time. ""Her bravery and fearlessness shone through right until the end. ""Our lives will never be the same, we'll miss her beautiful smile and zest for life. ""She will always be our hero and we are so immensely proud of her. Forever in our hearts."" Following the fire, Bicester Town Council opened books of condolence, while church services and a two-minute silence took place on Sunday. Nicholas Mawer, who represents Bicester North on Cherwell District Council, told the BBC those lost in the fire were ""the best of Bicester"". ""Thankfully these incidents are very rare but it's deeply affected the community,"" he added. Ms Logan and Mr Sadler were members of Bicester Rugby Union Football Club (BRUFC), with Ms Logan on the Bicester Vixens women's team. ""We are a tight-knit club,"" BRUFC's chairman Paul Jaggers said. ""Obviously losing two of your members in any situation is really tough and it's had a profound impact."" A fundraiser launched by the club has raised more than £11,000 for the Fire Fighters charity since the tragedy. Mr Jaggers described it as an ""initial start"". ""The intention was always to run some events later in the year to remember Jennie and Martyn, and raise money alongside those, so hopefully this is just the beginning,"" he added. The Bishop of Dorchester, the Right Reverend Gavin Collins, led a tribute on Tuesday at the first full meeting of Oxfordshire County Council since elections earlier this month. ""As we come together today, we hold in our hearts those who lost their lives in last Thursday's fire,"" Bishop Collins said. ""We give thanks for all those who serve in our emergency services for their courage, commitment and compassion."" Councillors were asked to pause sharing their own words in the chamber and sign a book of condolence. The fire was reported at about 18:30 BST on Thursday and rapidly spread through the former aircraft hangar at the site on Buckingham Road, and a major incident was declared. Ten fire and rescue crews were called to tackle the blaze as witnesses reported seeing black smoke in the sky. Bicester Motion is home to more than 50 specialist businesses, focused on classic car restoration and engineering on the former site of RAF Bicester. It was home to RAF Bomber Command in World War Two and became redundant in 2004. The Health and Safety Executive has confirmed it was ""liaising with our colleagues at Thames Valley Police"" as part of an investigation into the fire.

170750,Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Sheffield under threat,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7877exg4qxo,"Liberty Steel is making a last-ditch attempt to save its plants in and around Rotherham and Sheffield from collapse. On Wednesday, a court could force Liberty's speciality steel business to close over unpaid debts, putting 1,450 jobs are at risk, unless the company wins an adjournment. Liberty Steel told the BBC that discussions continue with creditors and that it ''understands the concern this will create for colleagues''. It added that it ''remains committed to doing all it can to maintain the speciality steel business"". Government sources told the BBC they are not prepared to step in to save Liberty or any of its subsidiaries to pay off outstanding debts. However, the government may look at stepping in if the company is forced into insolvency by the courts. Creditors, including Harsco Metals, have petitioned the court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty's assets can be sold to pay the money it owes. The court could order Liberty Steel to be wound up. One creditor, who owns a company that has worked with Liberty Steel and the plant's previous owners over several years told the BBC: ''Of all the owners of this plant we've worked with, Liberty Steel is the worst. You don't know if you're going to be paid from one day to the next.'' He said he was owed tens of thousands of pounds by Liberty Steel and the debt is putting jobs at risk at his company. The creditor told the BBC  that he ''totally understands'' why the government might not want to support Liberty Steel financially , adding ""I hope new owners can be found with the wherewithal to run this company properly"". Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, said the situation at Liberty Steel was ''deeply troubling'', adding that the Liberty plant was critical for speciality steel in aerospace, defence and Formula One. ''I have repeatedly urged the government to take all necessary steps to safeguard the plants themselves and the workforce,"" she said. ""I will continue to do all that I can to protect steel production in Rotherham."" Last month, the government took control of British Steel in Scunthorpe after being given the power to do so by an emergency vote in Parliament. It is now in charge of the day-to-day running of the plant to ensure the supply of coal necessary to keep its blast furnaces going. The government says its looking for a commercial partner but that nationalisation of the plant is the most likely option. A Department of Business and Trade spokesperson said: ""We continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are of course a matter for the company. ""It is ultimately for Liberty to manage commercial decisions on the future of its companies, and we hope it succeeds with its plans to continue on a sustainable basis."" British Steel says it has faced significant challenges due to rising energy costs and an over-reliance on cheap imports and said it would take time to deliver the improvements necessary to make it competitive. In November last year Liberty Steel sought court approval for a restructuring of its speciality steel UK division to reduce its liabilities but said last week that it had failed to reach an agreement with creditors. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. Most of the roles will be based at Scunthorpe, with others at the Teesside and  Skinningrove plants. A play examines how Port Talbot saw the arrival of a Banksy in town - and the death of its industry. Steel workers and their families can ""breathe a sigh of relief"", says the business secretary. The consultation over job losses that had been started by the company's previous owner ends. Copyright 2025 BBC.

966948,Tommy Robinson to be released from prison early,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gg8y2r1zo,"The far-right anti-Islam activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, is due to be released from prison four months early. His 18-month sentence for contempt of court was reduced after a hearing at the High Court on Tuesday. Yaxley-Lennon was jailed last October because he ignored an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him for libel. His lawyers told the court he had since shown a ""commitment"" to comply with the order. Mr Justice Johnson granted the application to have the sentence reduced because Yaxley-Lennon had shown a ""change in attitude"" since he was sentenced. The 42-year-old is due to be released from prison within the next week, the judge said. The judge noted there was an ""absence of contrition or remorse"" from Yaxley-Lennon, but added: ""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again."" The sentence handed down to Yaxley-Lennon in October was made up of two elements. The first was a 14-month ""punitive"" element, while the second was a four-month ""coercive"" element. At the time, Mr Justice Johnson said that the four-month ""coercive"" element could be removed from his sentence if he took steps to comply with the order that barred him from repeating lies about the Syrian refugee. This week, the High Court accepted Yaxley-Lennon had tried to comply with the order. The judge said ""the practical effect"" of this ""is that the defendant will be released once he has completed the punitive element, which I understand will be within the next week."" He was originally due to be released from prison on 26 July. Yaxley-Lennon attended the hearing via video-link from HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes. He showed no immediate reaction once the judgment was handed down. The former leader of the now-defunct English Defence League had wrongly claimed in a viral video that a Syrian teenager was a violent thug. The teenager successfully sued him for libel for these claims. In 2021, an injunction was made that barred Yaxley-Lennon from repeating the false allegations. He was jailed last year for 10 admitted breaches of the injunction after the Solicitor General issued two contempt claims against him. After being jailed, Yaxley-Lennon lost a bid to bring a legal challenge against the Ministry of Justice over his segregation from other prisoners at the jail in March. He subsequently lost a challenge to his sentence at the Court of Appeal in April. However, three senior judges said he could ""still reduce the period he has to spend in custody by taking the steps identified"" by the judge. Among the steps identified by the judge was that Yaxley-Lennon should remove social media posts that repeated the libellous claim about the Syrian national. Yaxley-Lennon's lawyer Alex Di Francesco told the court on Tuesday that these steps had been followed. ""The defendant has demonstrated that commitment that Your Lordship required, both in his words and his actions,"" he said. He continued: ""Each admitted breach capable of being purged has been acted upon and has been entirely resulted in removal."" Adam Payter, for the Solicitor General, said that a review had been carried out to assess whether the injunction had been complied with. He told the court that following the review, the Solicitor General ""agrees that the material has been removed from all bar two of the online locations"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

581038,Second man charged over fires at homes linked to PM,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3088p85pero,"A second man has been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged in relation to suspected arson at two properties and to a car linked to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Metropolitan Police has said. Romanian national Stanislav Carpiuc, 26, from Romford, was charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life following the fires in north London. He was arrested on 17 May and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning. The charges relate to three incidents - a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, north London, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street and a fire at an address that he previously lived in Islington, north London. The prosecution said the motive for the alleged offending was as yet ""unexplained."" Mr Carpiuc is accused of conspiring with Ukrainian national Roman Lavrynovych, 21, and others to ""damage by fire property belonging to another, intending to damage the property, intending to endanger the life of another or being reckless as to whether the life of another would thereby be endangered"", the Met said. Mr Lavrynovych, of Sydenham, appeared in court on Friday charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life. He denied the charges in a police interview. The chief magistrate, District Judge Paul Goldspring, remanded Mr Stanislav in custody until 6 June when he will appear alongside Mr Lavrynovych at the Old Bailey. Mr Carpiuc, who was born in Ukraine but has Romanian nationality, used a Russian language interpreter in court. He works in construction, is an aspiring actor and model, and has recently finished a business degree at Christchurch University, Canterbury. He lives in Chadwell Heath, Romford and has been in the UK for nine years. Mr Lavrynovych is also a builder and an aspiring model. A third man, aged 34, was arrested on Monday in the Chelsea area on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. He has not been named by police. On Thursday 8 May, a car that Sir Keir sold to a neighbour last year caught fire. The fire took place on the Kentish Town street where the prime minister lived before moving to Downing Street. In the early hours of Sunday 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington - a property the prime minister lived at during the 1990s. One person had to be rescued by firefighters who were using breathing apparatus. The following day, in the early hours of Monday 12 May, police were alerted by the London Fire Brigade to reports of a fire at Sir Keir's private home. Damage was caused to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt. The BBC understands the property is rented to the prime minister's sister-in-law. A boy, 17, and girl, 16, plead guilty to killing the animals found in a field on 3 May. A two-year-old boy has died after falling from height in south-east London, the Met Police said.

325859,Kenya signs Crown dependencies recruitment deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e0g2rd0no,"A Channel Islands business has signed a deal with the Kenyan government to enable staff to be recruited to work in the three UK Crown dependencies. The agreement between recruitment firm GR8 and the Kenyan government would pave the way for staff to be recruited to work in Jersey and Guernsey and on the Isle of Man, organisers said. Leaders said the agreement would make it easier for east African hospitality, construction, childcare and health workers to fill vacancies in the Crown dependencies. GR8 CEO Lee Madden signed a memorandum of understanding with Roseline Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, in a ceremony in Jersey. A GR8 spokesperson said the company was now a strategic partner for recruiting Kenyans into the Crown dependencies, strengthening business links with the east African country. Njogu said: ""We are inviting good employers to come and recruit from Kenya from the talent that we have that is abundant in IT, healthcare, education, engineering and so on."" Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, is on an official visit to Jersey, alongside Kenyan politicians and senior government officials. During their visit, they will also meet the Minister for External Relations Ian Gorst and representatives from organisations including Highlands College, Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the Jersey Construction Council. Minister for Sustainable Economic Development Kirsten Morel, said: ""I hope this partnership flourishes, ensuring that Jersey remains an attractive and welcoming place for overseas skilled workers from multiple industries to live and work."" Lee Madden, the chief executive of GR8, said the agreement enabled them to speak on behalf of the Kenyan government in terms of recruitment. He said the recruitment of hospitality staff from Kenya had been ""instrumental in solving the recruitment crisis that was three to four years ago"". GR8 began working with partners in Kenya five years ago, starting a close business relationship with a college that saw trained hospitality workers brought over to help support businesses struggling to recruit staff following Brexit. Since then, it has recruited hundreds of skilled workers from sectors including hospitality, construction and health care sectors into roles in Jersey and Guernsey, with the majority coming from Kenya.

125904,Energy price cap: What next for gas and electricity bills and can I fix?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd29v8mp9jo,"Gas and electricity bills are expected to fall in July, when a new price cap takes effect. It is likely to reverse the increase for millions of households on 1 April, under the current cap. The annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity rose to £1,849 per year, an increase of £111, in April. The energy price cap sets the maximum amount customers can be charged for each unit of energy, but actual bills depend on how much gas and electricity you use. The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and isset every three monthsby Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 April and 30 June 2025,gas prices are capped at 6.99p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 27.03p per kWh. This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energy is £1,849 per year. However, analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted that from 1 July this annual bill will fall to £1,720. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque pay £1,969. The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Between April and June, households on prepayment meters are paying slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of £1,803, a rise of £113 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in January 2025, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023mean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Fixed-price deals are not affected by the energy price cap, which changes every three months and can go up or down. They offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if energy prices drop when you are on the deal, you could be stuck at a higher price. You may also have to pay a penalty to leave a fixed deal early. Ofgem, the energy regulator, says customers who want the security of knowing what their bill will be should consider moving to a fixed deal. However, it says they should make sure they understand all the costs. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, recommends checking whole-of-market energy price comparison sites to help find the best deal. Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to gas and electricity supplies. Theyvary slightly by region. On 1 April, the average electricity standing charge fell from 60.97p to 53.8p but the average gas standing charge increased from 31.65p to 32.67p Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region saw larger increases. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a bigger proportion of the bill of low energy users. In response, Ofgem has said thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffs from winter 2025. One would have a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another no standing charge but a higher unit rate. However,the proposals have been criticised as being too complicated. TheHousehold Support Fund, which was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customers, has been extended until March 2026. TheWarm Home Discount schemecontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Schemecan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners have not received the money this winter. It is not necessary to have held a Mastercard to make a claim, after a court ruled historic fees the firm charged were unfair. A survey by the Felix Project finds food banks expect to see more demand over the next year. Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator's price cap. Lenders will have to carry out affordability checks and shoppers will have faster access to refunds under the plans. The UK economy grew by more than expected at the start of 2025.

264130,"Man who helped smuggle more than 3,000 people into Europe jailed",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce399l1329lo,"An Egyptian fisherman who helped organise the movement of more than 3,000 migrants as part of a £12 million illegal boat crossing operation has been jailed for 25 years. UK-basedAhmed Ebid, 42, was involved in smuggling nearly 3,800 people from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023, with some making their way to Britain, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Ebid is the first person in the UK to be convicted of being involved in people smuggling across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Italy. He arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 after spending five years in jail in Italy for attempted drug smuggling. He applied for asylum in the UK but never received a decision. That meant he had been in legal limbo, neither facing removal nor being granted permission to stay. His sentence means he will almost certainly be deported once it has been served. Ebid, whose wife and sons are in the UK, had been living in Home Office-funded accommodation in south-west London at the time of his arrest. At his sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, the judge said Ebid ruthlessly exploited desperate individuals and his ""primary motivation was to make money out of human trafficking"". ""The treatment of migrants was horrifying,"" Judge Adam Hiddleston said. ""This was a commercial enterprise, pure and simple. The risk of loss of life was considerable. These were fishing boats, not ferries"". Ebid ""exercised a managerial role at a very high level"", the court heard, bribing officials and ordering threats of violence towards the migrants. After he was sentenced, Ebid was heard in the dock shouting that it was ""unfair"" and that he was ""saving money to bring my family over"". While this was happening, a female member of Ebid's family cried in the public gallery. He was arrested in 2023 after Italian security services looked into satellite phones being used by migrants on Mediterranean crossings from Libya to Europe, in particular Italy. They found that some handsets which were being used to call the country's coastguard had also been connecting during the journey to a British mobile number. The NCA linked that mobile phone to Ebid and then bugged his home to record evidence. The agency found he was involved in a number of smuggling operations, transporting thousands of men, women and children, often in dangerously overcrowded fishing vessels. Ebid even told an associate to kill and throw any migrants caught with their phones into the sea, in a bid to avoid law enforcement, the NCA said. The smuggler had described himself on Facebook as ""Captain Ahmed"" and notebooks in his home included Mediterranean Sea navigational details and lists of payments related to crossings. Ebid had admitted facilitating illegal immigration to the EU - a crime under UK law - but disputed the importance of his role. The NCA's investigation revealed he had a management role in the smuggling network. Jacque Beer, regional head of investigation at the NCA, said: ""Ebid was part of a crime network who preyed upon the desperation of migrants to ship them across the Mediterranean in death trap boats. ""The cruel nature of his business was demonstrated by the callous way he spoke of throwing migrants into the sea if they didn't follow his rules. To him they were just a source of profit.""

783631,Islanders urged to try alternative travel methods,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w33qvn0gvo,"Islanders in Guernsey and Jersey are being urged to try alternative modes of transport, as part of a week-long campaign. Better Journeys Week - previously known as Alternative Transport Week is running this week and encourages people to leave their cars at home and use the bus, cycle or walk to work or school. As part of the initiative by the Better Journeys Project new signs have been installed around St Peter Port and St Helier, to show how long it takes to walk or cycle from key locations into the town centre. The project first launched in 2021 and this year marks the first time the two islands have come together under one banner to promote sustainable travel. The project said signs were located along popular commuter routes and outside residential areas. They added that the focus is on ""long-term behaviour change"" and the positive impacts of ""better travel habits"". Rollo de Sausmarez, director of the Better Journeys project in Guernsey, said he hoped the signs prompted ""more islanders to leave the car at home and take a better journey"". Kate Huntington, Jersey director, added; ""Whether it's a 10-minute bike ride or a 15-minute walk, these signs are a simple but effective way to show people that active travel is an option, not just during Better Journeys Week, but throughout the year."" Schools have been encouraging parents to take their children to school actively. Vicki Charlesworth, the head teacher of Les Landes School in Jersey started the cycling crocodile scheme in 2021, which allows children a chance to travel to school actively but safely. She said students enjoy walking and cycling to school and that it helped set them up for a ""successful day of learning"". While Claire Giles the head teacher at St Martin's Primary School in Guernsey, said they had supported the project since it first started and that students ""wanted to actively travel to school"". She said the school was the first in the bailiwick to have a ""school street"" which sees the road running past its main entrance shut for half an hour before and after school. Ms Giles said ""95% of children come to school actively already"" and that she has noticed a difference in students ""physical and mental health"". Follow BBC Guernsey onXandFacebook.

755957,Domestic abuse victim data stolen in Legal Aid hack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5g4pv2l0o,"A ""significant amount"" of private data including details of domestic abuse victims has been hacked from Legal Aid's online system. The Ministry of Justice said the agency's services were hacked in April and data dating back to 2010 was downloaded. The BBC understands that more than two million pieces of information were taken. The breach covers all areas of the aid system - including domestic abuse victims, those in family cases and others facing criminal prosecution. ""This data may have included... addresses of applicants, dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment and financial data such as... debts and payments,"" the MoJ said. The agency's chief executive Jane Harbottle apologised, saying she understood the news ""will be shocking and upsetting for people"". Justice minister Sarah Sackman told the House of Commons that there was no indication as yet that any other government systems had been affected by the breach. The MoJ said that while the initial cyber-attack was detected in April, it has since become apparent that the incident was ""more extensive than originally understood"". It also warned the public to be alert for any suspicious activity, including unknown messages or phone calls, and to update any potentially exposed passwords. ""If you are in doubt about anyone you are communicating with online or over the phone you should verify their identity independently before providing any information to them,"" it said. The ministry said it was working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre, and has informed the Information Commissioner. Legal aid is offered to cover the costs of legal advice, family mediation and representation in a court or tribunal for those who qualify. This includes those who are at risk of abuse or serious harm, discrimination, forced marriage, as well as those defending themselves in criminal cases. The Legal Aid Agency'sonline digital services, which are used by legal aid providers to log their work and get paid by the government, have been taken offline. The Law Society, which represents the legal profession, said the MoJ needed to ""get a grip of the situation immediately"" and notify all those affected individually. ""It is extremely concerning that members of the public have had their personal data compromised,"" it added. The agency is the latest victim in a series of recent cyber-attacks that have caused mass disruption. Earlier this month, luxury department store Harrods said it had ""restricted internet access at our sites"" following an attempt to gain access to its systems. An attack on Marks & Spencer in April caused it to lose out on millions of pounds of sales and left it struggling to get services back to normal. A similar incident at the Co-op forced it to shut down parts of its IT systems and disrupted deliveries of fresh stock. Copyright 2025 BBC.

759442,Ministers consider easing winter fuel payment cuts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr883ly337o,"Senior government figures are discussing whether to reverse the controversial decision to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners within weeks. More than nine million pensioners lost out on payments worth up to £300 after Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year. Discussions in government have included changing the threshold at which pensioners stop receiving the benefit, or restoring the payments to all pensioners. The talks are understood to be fluid, and have not yet reached a conclusion. The government may ultimately decide to stick with its existing policy. Any announcement could come as soon as the spending review on 11 June, when the chancellor will unveil government departments' budgets for the coming years. There have been reports that the government is considering whether to increase the £11,500 income threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the allowance. Some Labour MPs have blamed the winter fuel policy for the party's losses at last month's local elections, and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election. Simply abandoning the policy entirely is seen as a less likely outcome than adjusting the thresholds. However, the fact that this policy - one of the first decisions made by Labour upon entering office last last summer - is even under review shows the scale of concern in Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's team about its political impact. Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether the government was considering changing course, cabinet minister Pat McFadden replied: ""I can't say anything about that. When budgets are agreed, they're agreed in the round."" ""I've not been involved in a recent cabinet discussion about this,"" he said. He added that winter fuel payments do ""come up on the doorstep"" and acknowledged ""some decisions are more popular than others"". In an interview with the BBC's Newscast podcast on Monday, Reeves failed to rule out changing course on winter fuel. Reeves said the government faced a ""tough inheritance"" and took some ""tough decisions"" to stabilise the public finances after winning last year's general election. But she added: ""I do understand the concerns that people have."" She said she would ""continue to listen to understand the concerns that people have raised"". ""We are a government that listens,"" the chancellor said. ""But we would always need to show where the money is going to come from if we're going to make any policy changes. That would be part of the normal process."" Her comments mark a change in tone since Reeves urged Labour MPs to back her plan to cut winter fuel payments in September last year. At a meeting of Labour MPs that month, Reeves told Labour backbenchers: ""It is the right thing to do, to target money at a time when finances are so stretched, at people who need them most."" Earlier this month, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman told reporters there ""will not be a change to the government's policy"" on the winter fuel payment, despite growing calls within Labour ranks for a rethink. Some MPs raised questions about the payment as they grilled Sir Keir at a meeting in Parliament on Monday. Speaking to the BBC ahead of that meeting, Labour MP Stella Creasy said it would be ""remiss"" of the government to dismiss concerns over the winter fuel payment. ""Those concerns are being heard across the party,"" Creasy said. ""Those of us who have been around a long time and among new MPs, there's a genuine concern to get this right and that's now what the government needs to respond to."" The Liberal Democrats said it remained to be seen whether the chancellor had listened. ""This U-turn is taking so long it puts turning an oil tanker around to shame,"" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said. ""The government should feel embarrassed that it has taken a dire set of a local election results to realise what everyone has known from the start: this policy was doomed to fail and punished some of the most vulnerable."" The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of £200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to £300 for over-80s, paid in November or December. Last year, the government restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid to save £1.4bn. The move did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto. It was seen as a key issue at this month's local elections, at which Labour lost 187 council seats and control of the only council it was defending. The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 by New Labour as a universal payment for all pensioners. It was billed as a way to guarantee they would be able to pay for increased heating costs over the winter - although in practice it is a pension top-up, which recipients can spend on whatever they want. This year state pensions are going up by 4.1% - a rise of £363 a year for those on the basic pension, or £472 for those on the new pension.

319891,Woman who killed partner as he slept jailed for 12 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj09zvmjmr8o,"A woman has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for the murder of her partner in west Belfast in 2022 Julie Ann McIlwaine, of Hazel Close, Lagmore, stabbed James Joseph Crossley, 38, while he slept at her former home in Filbert drive in Dunmurry on 2 March 2022. The 34-year-old had admitted killing Mr Crossley but denied his murder. During the trial the court heard how the pair were in a relationship marred by domestic abuse and coercive control.  In October 2024, jurors at Coleraine Crown Court rejected her argument and found her guilty after nine hours of deliberations. The judge, Mr Justice Kinney, described the murder of Mr Crossley as ""brutal and savage''. He told the defendant that after serving the minimum of 12 years in custody, it would be up to parole commissioners to decide whether it was safe to release her back into the community. At the time of his death, James Crossley was on bail for an assault against McIlwaine and was subject to a restraining order prohibiting him from being in contact with her. The defence said McIlwaine was suffering from a temporary ""stress reaction"" brought on by the trauma of her abusive relationship. The prosecution told the court that the defendant's ""rational choices"" on the night of the stabbing proved that she was in control of what she was doing. On the day he was killed, the court heard Mr Crossley and McIlwaine had been arguing on and off. He had told her she would need to ""choose between him and her family"" and took medication and went to sleep in bed beside their 10-month-old baby. In police interviews played to the court, McIlwaine told police that ""it all just got on top of me"" and she thought about taking her own life. ""I was getting all these thoughts in my head. I didn't know what was going on. I felt like a psychopath,"" she said. She described to police how she went downstairs to the kitchen, took the biggest knife there and went back to the attic room where Mr Crossley was asleep beside the infant. ""I set the baby to the end of the bed. I knew to get her out of the way. I didn't want to get blood on her."" McIlwaine then stabbed Mr Crossley 10 times. He was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital but died a short time later. A pathologist told the court that his cause of death was given as seven stab wounds to the chest and abdomen and he had further wounds to his arms and legs. Following Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Det Insp Michelle Griffin of the PSNI said it  has been an ""extremely difficult case"" involving two people who had been in a ""mutually abusive relationship"". She said that it had left ""so many family members, including children, totally heartbroken. ""There are no winners here. Only sorrow prevails."" The detective added: ""It's a sad reminder that no-one should ever take the law into their own hands, and I want to appeal to anyone, irrespective of gender or background, who is experiencing, or has experienced, domestic abuse to please speak to us.""

597616,First minister accused of lacking say on EU deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxx42yk0vo,"Wales' first minister Eluned Morgan has been accused by her political rivals of lacking a voice in the UK government's negotiations with the European Union. On Monday the former Labour MEP welcomed the new deal struck between the UK and the EU, but said she would have liked ""more discussion"" with the UK government over fishing. In the Welsh Parliament, the Welsh Conservative's Darren Millar said Morgan did not ""have a voice"", while Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said Sir Keir Starmer was treating Wales with ""contempt"". Morgan said the agreement was a ""good deal for Wales"" and that many issues raised by the Welsh government had been addressed in it. The agreement struck with the EU covers fishing, the ability of young people to move freely and defence,among other issues. It will see the two sides work on a joint food safety agreement which, if implemented, would reduce paperwork and ease checks. EU fishing vessels will also get 12 more years of access to UK waters. The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations (NFFO) said it was ""very disappointed"" with the deal. On Monday Morgan, asked if the Welsh government had been consulted over the effect on fishing, said there had been talks but that she ""would have liked more discussion"". ""We've had an idea of what's been going on the whole time but the detail wasn't finalised until the past few days,"" she said. Control of fishing is devolved to the Welsh government. In first minister's question time in the Senedd, Welsh Tory Senedd leader Millar said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had ""reopened the old Brexit battles that we have already fought and won and made some appalling announcements"". ""Let's be clear about what this deal means: free movement back, payments to the EU back, EU rules back, our fishing industry here in Wales betrayed, an unacceptable mobility scheme."" He said the deal ""will decimate our Welsh fishing industry"" and accused Morgan of selling ""our fishing industry down the river"". In response to Millar, Morgan said: ""I'll tell you what I do know is the Tories botched Brexit. ""What we will see now is much better opportunities for jobs in this country because people will be able to export to the EU for the first time without that red tape that occurred before."" Millar later added that the UK government ""did not consult with this Welsh Labour government in spite of the fact that many parts of this deal are going to have an impact here"". Morgan argued that the Welsh shellfish industry, ""which is actually much greater than our fisheries industry sector, are very happy"". ""From now on, they will be able to export their goods to the continent without them sitting and waiting and having to fill in forms at the borders"", she said. In his series of questions, Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was ""pleased that there is some acceptance now of the harm of Brexit"". But he said the deal was ""not bold enough in its response"". ""Yes, the Tories did botch Brexit,"" he said, ""but Labour also is botching its response to the Brexit damage."" He said: ""In yet another signal that Wales' voice matters little to UK Labour, the first minister has admitted... she was again side-lined."" Morgan said: ""It's really important for us to recognise that this is a good deal for Wales."" She listed a number of issues, such as ""bringing down export barriers"", defence and steel and youth movement that were ""all on our list of things that we wanted to see"" which she said had been ""worked through with relevant"" UK government departments. Describing herself as a ""euro-enthusiast,"" Morgan said she was ""gutted"" that the UK left the EU, but wanted ""as close as possible a deal with the European Union in order for our country and our nation to thrive"". Ap Iorwerth accused Morgan of wavering from her belief the Welsh government would benefit from membership of the single market and the custom union. ""We have a first minister who says she's a euro-enthusiast, but that's in words only,"" he said. The plan also sees sweet treats and fried food being cut down in primary schools. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. Tom Weaver lives in temporary accommodation run by a charity but struggles to find a permanent home.

81862,Deputies clash over inter-island ferry offer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0l2r7gmy4o,"Politicians in Jersey and Guernsey have clashed over inter-island ferry travel. The island's governmentschose different firms to operate services to the UK and France for the next 15 years, but under the new arrangement there are fewer large vessels travelling between Jersey and Guernsey. Authorities said they had now been approached by a group, called FerryBridge, offering to run vehicle and freight services between the islands. Deputy Kirsten Morel, who was responsible for Jersey's ferry negotiations, said he was ""willing to support"" the idea, but Deputy Neil Inder, who ran Guernsey's negotiations, said it was too early in the new arrangements. Deputy Kirsten Morel, the Sustainable Economic Development Minister who handled the ferry negotiations for Jersey, said island authorities were interested in the offer from FerryBridge. ""Jersey has said it's absolutely willing to support that, we've not received positive responses from Guernsey,"" he said. ""I am slightly concerned that we're being offered solutions and Jersey wants these solutions but we're being pushed back elsewhere, and I do wonder why that's the case."" Deputy Neil Inder, President of Guernsey's Committee for Economic Development, said Morel's comments had left him angry. ""'I'm incredulous that a minister in Jersey appears to have no ability to look in the rear-view mirror,"" he said. ""I have already advised the people behind FerryBridge that it is too early in the new ferry arrangements and any ferry proposal seeking ramp access would be incompatible with Guernsey's current contractual, legal and ramp licensing arrangements. ""Deputy Morel is fully aware of our position, so there shouldn't be any lack of clarity on his part."" Inder is one of 82 candidates standing in Guernsey's general election -see a full list here. Despite a lack of options for people wanting to take their vehicles between the islands, there are a number of services for foot passengers. Guernsey company Islands Unlimited launched an inter-island ferry service offeringa daily inter-island foot passenger serviceon high-speed catamaran capable of carrying 316 passengers from June. Chad Murray, operations director for Islands Unlimited, hoped the service provides more certainty for people wanting to travel between the islands. ""They want something that they know is the same each day of the week,"" he said. ""Not only for the general public, but also for a lot of the tour operators that are trying to have confidence to sell experiences to visitors in both islands.""

916938,"Girl unlawfully killed at water park, coroner says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvmme1q035o,"An 11-year-old girl who drowned during a birthday party at a water park in Berkshire was unlawfully killed following gross breaches in health and safety, a coroner has concluded. Kyra Hill got into difficulty in a designated swimming area at Liquid Leisure near Windsor in August 2022. An inquest at Berkshire Coroner's Court in Reading was told how Kyra, from Croydon, south London, was found more than an hour after emergency services were first alerted. The owner of the park wasfined £80,000 in June 2024. Breaches included the lack of an emergency plan or a risk assessment, the inquest heard. The only warning signs related to shallow water, despite depths reaching 4.67m (15.3ft) in parts of the swimming area, which senior coroner Heidi Connor said were ""falsely reassuring"". Mrs Connor said the fact parents were not made aware of the risks or the depth of the water was ""likely to have caused or contributed more than minimally"" to Kyra's death. ""If there had been systems in place to make parents and carers aware that there were deep parts of the water, that there was a requirement for one adult per four children in the water... then it is unlikely that Kyra would have got into trouble in the water as she did,"" she said. Mrs Connor also said poor visibility in the water - described as ""zero"" by the diver who found Kyra - also contributed to her death, and that if an emergency plan or risk assessment was in place, the other risk factors would have been reduced. Her father, Leonard Hill, fought back tears as he read a pen portrait of his daughter at the inquest on Tuesday. ""Kyra was a beautiful, beaming beacon of light in the lives of all who were fortunate enough to know her"", he said. Speaking outside court, Kyra's father described his daughter as ""precious and irreplaceable"". ""Our beloved Kyra was a remarkably strong and exceptional swimmer, a true champion in the water,"" he said. ""Yet, despite her strength, her life was tragically cut short."" Mr Hill said he was going to campaign for tighter safety regulations at water parks. A 17-year-old lifeguard spotted Kyra struggling at about 15:20 BST on 6 August 2022 and dived in after her, before leaving the water to tell colleagues. A manager quickly attended, but emergency services were only called 37 minutes afterwards, Mrs Connor said previously. A diver missed several calls and he entered the water in an effort to find Kyra at about 16:30, finding her at about 17:10. Life jackets were only required for children aged three to five at the water park, or for those who were not competent swimmers. Kelly Edwards, who was at the park that day with her daughter, described the situation after Kyra went missing as a ""nightmare"". She recalled asking a senior member of staff to stop the music as it was ""so loud"" and requested they make ""an announcement that a child was missing"" but they did not, the inquest heard. ""It was like a nightmare that wouldn't stop, the music wasn't stopping, people were carrying on, still in the waters,"" she said. ""They weren't being moved and I was screaming for Kyra, for people to do something."" Liquid Leisure's owner and director Stuart Marston told the inquest the incident was taken ""very seriously"" from the moment he was made aware. ""I'm a parent myself, of three children, and losing a child sends any parent into a panic,"" he said. Mr Marston said on the day of the incident he had shut the gates to the waterpark, as he could not be sure it was not an abduction. ""We had conflicting reports of where Kyra was last seen, it was very difficult and confusing - I was panicking,"" he added. You can followBBC BerkshireonFacebook,X (Twitter), orInstagram.

1089049,Pet owners urged to be aware of travel checks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw72xg4rppo,"People planning to take their pets to Northern Ireland are being urged to be aware of new rules set to come into effect. From 4 June, routine checks on animal health certificates (AHC), which are issued by vets for each journey, will be carried out at ports in Belfast and Larne. The Isle of Man government said the changes were part of the implementation of the Brexit deal, which sets trading rules between the UK and the country. Minister for Environment, Food and Agriculture Clare Barber urged pet owners to ""plan ahead to avoid disruption or distress"" as the shift represented a ""significant change for pet owners"" . ""Please speak to your vet in good time, and check official guidance before you travel,"" she said. The requirement for the certificate remains unchanged, but the inspections are set to be introduced to align the island with other jurisdictions. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, which operates ferry services to Belfast, is working with the Manx government to make people aware of the changes. Pet owners travelling by ferry must report for the checks at a facility in Belfast upon arrival. To travel from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland pets must be microchipped and be vaccinated against rabies. They are required to enter via a recognised point of entry, and dogs must be treated for tapeworm. All pet owners must also be able to provide a valid AHC or EU Pet Passport. Scheduled commercial flights from the Isle of Man do not currently allow pets, but those travelling by private aircraft must follow the same rules.

613801,Sex worker 'terrified' by plans for new prostitution law,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xw1xrq4lo,"At 17 years old, Alice was sacked from her job in a call centre. Her home environment was difficult. She had no CV and few employment options. A friend had been involved in sex work and had made ""a lot of money"". Alice decided to go down a similar road. Now in her 30s, she's still involved in sex work, though she balances it with other job opportunities. But Alice (not her real name) believes a potential change in the law in Scotland will make her ""terrifyingly"" unsafe. Alba MSP Ash Regan is introducing a bill that would make it an offence to pay for sexual services. It's an approach often referred to as the ""Nordic Model"". The former SNP leadership candidate argues that challenging men's demand for prostitution will help to protect women. Regan says that ""buying sexual access to a human being is a form of male violence"", and she's determined to see the law reformed. As things currently stand paying for sex is not illegal in Scotland. But some activities which are sometimes connected– such as running a brothel, loitering in a public place to buy or sell sex or persuading someone to take up prostitution – are against the law. Regan also wants to see women involved in selling sex offered ""exit alternatives"" and a legal right to support. And she wants to see any previous convictions for soliciting repealed. But these proposals have split those who want to keep sex workers safe. Alice explains that the internet has changed the landscape for what she calls ""full-service sex workers"" (people who exchange sex for money). She says there are now more opportunities for those selling sex to ""screen"" potential clients. This can involve asking to see photo ID before meeting a client, asking for a link to their social media or even requesting references from other sex workers. It's not a failsafe process, but it can help to check whether people are who they claim to be. But she is concerned about the potential change in the law in Scotland. Most of Alice's unease around the bill revolves around safety. She insists ""there's a difference between good clients and bad clients"". If buying sex is criminalised, then she fears that the ""good clients"" will disappear and ""you'll just be left with people who don't care about you as they don't care about breaking the law"". ""I would assume that anyone who doesn't care about breaking the law is more likely to be dangerous"", she says. She worries that a change in the law would make screening clients harder, as anyone who's still willing to buy sex illegally won't be willing to share their details. Alice argues that all these factors combine to mean that Ash Regan's proposals would make her ""terrifyingly"" less safe. ""My body would become a crime scene, wouldn't it? So why would I go to the police? I wouldn't even go to the police now,"" she says. Alice believes that further decriminalisation is what would ultimately make her safer, providing her with more protections and enabling a better relationship with the police. But Regan's proposal is to offer a route out of sex work for someone like Alice. Is that a prospect that appeals to her? Alice is sceptical. She thinks this sounds like swapping sex work for a minimum wage job, which she says ""doesn't really change why people end up choosing to do sex work in the first place"". Ash Regan is unwilling to tolerate the status quo. She argues that it's fundamentally ""a system of exploitation and violence"" that affects the most vulnerable women in society. The Alba MSP describes her bill as ""a departure from the failed approach of decriminalising the sex trade without addressing the root cause and consequences of commodifying human beings: demand."" The most effective way to do this, she argues, is to criminalise those who are paying for sex. Regan told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""We need to shift the balance of criminality onto those that are perpetuating this system of inequality and violence, and that is the buyers and the buyers are almost always male. ""The data shows that if you implement and enforce this law it will reduce the market of prostitution which means less women will be harmed."" The MSP said the data from other European countries is ""very clear"". In Sweden, where the Nordic model was implemented 25 years ago, no women working in prostitution have been killed, she said. She compared this to Germany where, since 2002, a decriminalisation approach has been adopted. She said this has led to the murder of 99 and attempted murder of 60 sex workers. She has promised to ""confront the injustice of commercial sexual exploitation head-on"" and has the backing of a number of women's groups. However, there is also a campaign that has been specifically set up to oppose her proposals, with sex workers stressing safety concerns. The debate about how to legislate with regards to selling sex is a contentious one. Even the term ""sex worker"" is rejected by some, including Regan. And every person involved in this world will have their own unique story and set of circumstances. It's rare to have someone like Alice willing to do an interview and speak so frankly – but she does not speak on behalf of every sex worker in Scotland. Regan has the support of other individuals who have previously been involved in sex work. This all highlights how sensitive this debate could become, with different camps passionately believing that their own approach is the right one. If her bill was to become law, Scotland would not be the first place in the UK to criminalise the buying of sex. It has been a crime to pay for sex in Northern Ireland since 2015. A2019 independent review by Queen's University Belfastfound that the law did not appear to have the desired effect. Despite a tightening up of the law, sex workers reported increased demand for their services and it found that more sex workers were advertising online. Researchers added that sex workers felt ""further marginalised and stigmatised"". The report concluded that the change in the Northern Irish law had ""minimal effect on the demand for sexual services."" But there are those – like Ash Regan – who believe that reform can quash demand, make women safer, and provide alternative employment opportunities. This debate could ultimately go nowhere in the foreseeable future. With a Scottish election due in 2026, bills that don't complete their parliamentary journey in that timeframe will fall by the wayside. Opposition towards this bill remains. And MSPs will now have to think about where they stand on this issue, if they haven't done so already. Its biggest obstacle could yet be time.

Lucy Connolly, from Northampton, wasjailed for 31 monthsin October after calling for ""mass deportation now"" and urging her followers on X to ""set fire"" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The tweet was viewed 310,000 times before it was deleted. Judges at the Court of Appeal have now ruled that ""there is no arguable basis on which it could be said that the sentence imposed by the judge was manifestly excessive"". Connolly posted the swearword-ridden message on 29 July 2024 - the day three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. While calling for ""mass deportations now"", the 41-year-old childminder wrote: ""If that makes me racist, so be it."" She urged readers to ""set fire"" to ""all the hotels"" that were ""full"" of those she wished to deport. The post had been deleted before Connolly was arrested on 6 August but it had already been viewed 310,000 times. She wasjailed at Birmingham Crown Courtafter pleading guilty to inciting racial hatred and told that she would serve 40% of her sentence in prison before being released on licence.

1101304,Supplier to major supermarkets hit by cyber attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr88myp570o,"A distributor to the UK's major supermarkets has said it is being held to ransom by cyber hackers. Logistics firm Peter Green Chilled said it supplies supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, but it is relatively small compared with larger UK food distributors. It toldBBC's Wake Up to Moneyclients were ""receiving regular updates"" including ""workarounds"" on how to continue deliveries while one of its customers said thousands of their products could go to waste. Recent major cyber-attacks onMarks & SpencerandCo-opwere larger, but the attack highlights the challenges smaller logistics firms face, an industry source said. In an email sent on Thursday, seen by the BBC, Peter Green Chilled said it had been the victim of a ransomware attack. A ransomware attack is when hackers encrypt a victim's data and lock them out of computer systems, demanding payment to hand back control. The email said no orders would be processed on Thursday, although any order prepared on Wednesday would be sent. Peter Green Chilled confirmed to the BBC the cyber attack happened on Wednesday evening but it said it was not in a position to discuss further. ""The transport activities of the business have continued unaffected throughout this incident,"" its managing director Tom Binks said. One of Peter Green Chilled's customers, Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, said he had ""something like ten pallets worth of meat products"" with Peter Green Chilled. He said if those products don't get to the retailers in time they will have to be ""thrown in the bin"". Ten pallets is ""thousands and thousands of packs of products, sitting there, and the clock is ticking,"" he said. ""There's no information. Everything along the chain has to be stopped, and then there are thousands of pounds worth of product that are just wasting away."" Peter Green Chilled is a firm based near Shepton Mallet in Somerset that transports chilled food, mainly to regional stores. There are much larger chilled food distributors in the UK - for example, Lineage, GXO, and Culina. An industry source said these big firms, which distribute the largest volume of chilled food in the UK and internationally, have the resources to try to combat cyber attacks, while smaller firms may not. However, Phil Pluck, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, said the warehousing, food storage and distribution sectors were ""constantly under attack"". A few years ago, there were a few cyber and ransomware attacks, but in the last year there has been ""a huge increase"", he said. About half of the food consumed in the UK ""goes through the cold chain sector"", he said, so hackers ""know how critical"" distribution is for ""putting food on supermarket shelves"". He added that was ""a really good lever to put the pressure on our companies to actually pay that ransomware"". Mr Pluck said that he knew of at least ten attacks on member companies, but that firms like to keep attacks ""under the radar"". He said cyber attacks were ""hugely underreported"" in any sector ""because once you're attacked you lose control of your company"" both through the attack and the mitigations by police and insurers. Co-op narrowly avoided being locked out of its systems during an attack which exposed customer data and caused shortages of stock. A ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack on M&S which saw customer data stolen and empty shelves. The retailer itself said it had suffered a cyber attack. Sian John, chief technology officer at tech security firm NCC Group, said one ""weak spot"" for retail was its supply chain. She said threats from hackers are ""not confined to high-profile retailers or major brands"" but also exist in the links that connect them. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, there were 202 ransomware attacks on local councils in 2024. Experts say it will be difficult to find a new use for the House of Fraser building. The BBC investigates one of the most damaging ranswomare attacks on a UK local council. BBC's Joe Tidy spoke directly to those who claim they are responsible for hacking M&S and Co-op. The retailer has been struggling to get its services back to normal after a cyber-attack in April. Copyright 2025 BBC.

964668,What does the UK-EU deal mean for holidays and jobs? Your questions answered,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8nnxrzr07o,"Many of you have been submitting questions to Your Voice, Your BBC News about the deal signed this week between the UK and European Union. Your questions have touched on a range of issues, including jobs, food and travel. Our experts have been digging into the detail to figure out what the deal means for you and your family. Anna Maria, a dental student studying in Bulgaria, asked about mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which was a Labour Party manifesto pledge. Our political reporter Becky Morton has looked into the details of the deal. In its manifesto last year, Labour said it would seek to ""secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications, external to help open up markets for UK service exporters"". That would mean professionals such as doctors, lawyers and accountants who qualified in one country could practice in another with minimal extra bureaucracy - a system already in place across the EU. Monday's deal promises to set up ""dedicated dialogues"" on the recognition of professional qualifications, but a full agreement could take much longer to negotiate. Such an agreement would make it easier for British companies to move staff between the UK and EU and undertake short-term work in Europe. However, there may be less incentive for the EU to agree a deal, given the current situation makes it harder for UK firms to compete for business in Europe. Malcolm in Bristol wanted more clarity on what the agreement will mean for passport queues for UK citizens visiting the EU. Our transport correspondent Simon Browning explains. While some EU ports and airports already allow UK citizens to use modern e-gates, many do not and queues have become familiar to holidaymakers. The new agreement provides more clarity on e-gates and sets out that in the future, UK citizens will be able to use them - but the EU Commission says that will not come into force in time for this summer. However, the UK government has indicated it is hopeful there could be changes in time for the summer, so the timeline still appears to be up for debate. The EU says there will be no change before a new EU border security scheme comes into force in October, which will see biometric data including fingerprints collected from passengers coming from non-EU countries such as the UK. It will mean manned desks where people will have to queue in order to enter some EU countries could still be a feature of travel beyond this year, even if e-gate usage becomes more widely available. In short, that will mean long queues at some destinations could continue during this holiday season and perhaps beyond. Any decision about UK citizens using e-gates will not be a blanket one across the bloc. Instead, it will be up to individual countries to decide how they manage queues at their borders. We have received a lot of questions about pet passports. Our political correspondent Jack Fenwick has looked into when the scheme will be up and running. In short, we just do not know yet whether there will be any change in time for this summer. The agreement between the UK and EU commits to introducing a new passport system which would make it easier for people to travel with their pets and end the need to acquire repeat vet certificates. Many British holidaymakers will be keen for these rules to be introduced in time for their trip this year. However, so-called pet passports come under a part of the deal known as the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement - and while the UK and EU have agreed to work together in this area, the full scope of it has not been fully fleshed out yet. Chris in Bristol asked whether UK farmers would have to accept EU regulations on food standards. Our business correspondent Simon Jack has assessed the impact. The new agreement removes the need for time consuming and costly veterinary checks and forms - but in return, the UK will have to align with EU food standards. As those regulations change, the UK will have to change too. The government insists it will have a say in how those rules develop and it may be able to negotiate exceptions - but they will not have a vote. The National Farmers Union has broadly welcomed the new deal because it provides easier and quicker access to a big market for perishable products, in which the speed that goods can be moved is important. Andy in Eastbourne asked whether this deal would allow for the free and unrestricted movement of musicians and bands on tour in Europe. Our political reporter Becky Morton answered. Since Brexit, British musicians have faced extra costs and red tape when touring Europe. The industry has been urging the government to find a solution and Labour's general election manifesto pledged to ""help our touring artists"" as part of negotiations with the EU. But the deal agreed on Monday only recognises the ""value"" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts ""to support travel and cultural exchange"". The UK says it will explore ""how best to improve arrangements for touring across the European continent"". Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed this as ""an important first step"" but said the sector was seeking ""more concrete commitments"". Brian in Nottingham asked about any knock-on effect the agreement may have on the UK's ability to negotiate trade deals with other nations. Political correspondent Jack Fenwick looked into it for him. If the UK was to re-join the customs union or single market, there would be knock-on effects for other trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership - but this relatively limited agreement does not go nearly that far. However, the UK will now effectively be a rule-taker when it comes to EU standards on food and farming exports - but the government is fairly comfortable with that for two reasons. Firstly, ministers do not want to lower food standards anyway, which we saw during recent trade negotiations with the US. Secondly, the level of trade the UK has with the EU massively outstrips other agreements signed in recent years. This UK-EU deal is expected to eventually boost the economy by around £9bn a year, largely from food, farming and energy trading. Compare that with the much broader agreement signed with India this year, which will bring economic benefits of around £5bn a year. Neil Heard asked whether people who owned properties in the EU before Brexit would be able to spend more time there? Political analyst Peter Barnes checked it out. There was nothing in the new agreement that would change the rules in this respect. If a UK citizen travels to the Schengen area, which covers most of the EU and some other European countries, you do not need a visa but you can only stay for 90 days in any 180 day period. The rule applies even if the 90 days is made up of multiple trips, and also if you stay in more than one Schengen area country. It is the total number of days that counts. Ireland and Cyprus are not in the Schengen area and UK citizens have the right to live and work in Ireland - but for people with holiday homes in France and other EU countries, the rules are not changing. The Schengen agreement abolished many of Europe's internal borders, allowing freedom of movement between the countries which are signed up to it. A reader in Scotland asked about the impact on the local fishing industry. Scotland editor James Cook spelled out what it means for the whole of the UK. To understand what has gone on, we need to go back to when the UK was a member of the EU. Back then, fishing quotas were governed by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) under which EU boats could catch fish in UK waters and vice versa. This was very unpopular with many UK fishermen who complained, accurately, that under the CFP they caught far fewer fish in EU waters than EU fishermen caught in UK waters. After Brexit, the UK and the EU agreed that EU vessels could still fish in UK waters until 30 June 2026, but that 25% of the EU's quota in UK waters (by value of fish landings) would gradually be transferred to the UK. From 1 July 2026, EU-UK deals for fishing access were going to be negotiated annually. But this new deal maintains the current position in terms of EU access to UK waters for 12 years, a move criticised by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation as a ""total capitulation"" by the UK government. Downing Street stressed that the EU quota in UK waters has not increased, and says the deal provides certainty - as well as streamlining the process for selling UK fish and shellfish in the EU. The state borrows to fund day-to-day spending as well as long-term infrastructure projects. The EU-UK trade deal has been praised as a ""leap foward"" and ""genuine progress"" by some of the UK's major business groups. Growers say they are seeing bigger, sweeter berries due to recent warm days and cool nights. Thousands of people are expected to attend, with four days of sunshine forecast. The strength of the economy affects things like pay rises and how much tax the government can raise to pay for services. Copyright 2025 BBC.

313025,"Gulf pact next after EU trade deal, says Reeves",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce802rygr02o,"The UK wants to strike a trade deal with countries in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar, as its next move, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC. She claimed the UK was now in a better place on trade ""than any other country in the world"", following major trade deals with India, the US and the EU that were signed this month. Reeves also suggested that the prospect of closer trading relationships would boost forecasts for UK growth. But opposition parties have criticised the government for some of the concessions offered in return for trade deals. In early April, the government said it was continuing discussions with Gulf nations, started by the previous Conservative government, which focused on boosting UK food and drink, renewable energy and manufacturing exports, and attracting more inward investment into the UK. If that is the government's next deal it may prove politically controversial, given the human rights record of some of the six countries involved. However, Reeves said the UK was ""not looking to have trade negotiations with China"", which could raise similar objections. Reeves was speaking to the BBC in the wake of the announcement of a trade pact with the EU on Monday, which has prompted criticism from opposition parties. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the latest EU deal took the UK ""backwards"", while Reform leader Nigel Farage said on social media that Labour had ""sold out"" the fishing industry and called the EU an ""ever-diminishing political union"". Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the EU deal was a ""welcome stepping stone"", but called for the government to go further and agree to a customs union. The deal with the EU, including fishing, trade, defence and energy, marks the biggest agreement between the parties since the UK left the trading bloc in 2020 following the Brexit vote. That pact follows hot on the heels of a trade deal with India which makes it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to the country, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The government has also secured an agreement with US President Donald Trump to reducetariffs on some goods traded between the nations. Reeves suggested to the BBC that Britain's economic growth forecast was on course to be upgraded as a result of the three trade agreements. When the government's official forecasting body provides its assessment of the economy alongside the autumn Budget, it would take into account stronger than expected growth in the first three months of the year, and improved trading relations, she said. ""We are forecasting growth of 1% this year, and we had 0.7% in Q1 and they'll take into account the new trade deals that have been secured,"" said Reeves. The ""reset"" with the EU only removes some of the additional barriers to trade resulting from Brexit, and so is only expectedto boost growth by less than half a per cent. Economists say more economic benefits could be gained from rejoining the single market and customs union and allowing freedom of movement, but those are ""red lines"" the government has said it will not cross. A higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created by businesses investing, but it would also give the chancellor more room to manoeuvre when it comes to tax or borrowing rises, or spending cuts. However, the strong uptick in growth between January and March is not expected to last, in part due to the effect of US tariffs on global growth. EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said business organisations and firms, ranging from defence to the supermarkets, had welcomed the agreement because it would be ""economically advantageous up and down the country"". He conceded that not all of the government's ambitions had been achieved, including establishing new rules allowing musicians, performers, accountants and lawyers to work more easily in the EU. Shadow foreign minister, Priti Patel, said she was ""all for reducing cost and bureaucracy"" but criticised the deal's ""lack of detail"". Pushed on why the previous Conservative government had not pursued a new deal with the EU earlier she told the BBC's Today Programme the original Brexit arrangement had always been ""transitional"". ""We all knew we would go back and look at further discussions,"" she said. It appears the government had the EU, the UK's largest trading partner, in mind during its talks with the US and India. As part of the deal with the EU, in return for extending current fishing rules, checks have been reduced on UK food exports. Reeves said UK officials had made it clear to the Trump administration and India that food standards were not up for negotiation in their agreements. ""We increased the quota for the import of beef from the US, it was all still on the high standards that we pride ourselves in, and in part because standards matter to us, but also because we wanted to secure this agreement with the EU, which is by far the biggest market for UK agriculture and fishing,"" the chancellor said. Both sides agreed to cooperate further on a ""youth experience scheme"" allowing young people to work and travel more freely again, but this is subject to further negotiations. Reeves described the recent trade agreements as having ""come along like buses"" and said ""Britain is in a better place than any other country in the world in terms of deals with those countries"". ""The first deal and the best deal so far with the US, we've got the best deal with the EU for any country outside the EU, and we've got the best trade agreement with India,"" Reeves added. ""Not only are these important in their own right, but it also shows that Britain now is the place for investment and business, because we've got preferential deals with the biggest economies around the world.""

468903,Adoptive therapy funding cuts 'disgusting' - mother,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2rpypmp9o,"A mother has described government cuts to therapy funding for adopted children as ""disgusting"". Lucy Williams, from Gloucestershire, adopted her daughter four years ago and has used the fund for specialist assessments and play therapy. But the government announced in April that theAdoption and Special Guardianship Support Fund (ASGSF) would be cutby 40% per child and Ms Williams is now worried her daughter may not be able to access the therapy she needs. The Department for Education said the decisions it has taken ""will ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support"". Ms Williams, who describes her daughter as ""sassy"" with a ""wicked laugh"", said the fund had been a lifeline for them - giving them a framework to follow in order to support her needs. The funding would usually cover specialist occupational therapy, play therapy and time with a counsellor, which Ms Williams says is vital for young people, many of whom have faced early trauma. ""This support is not a luxury, it's an absolute necessity,"" Ms Williams said, adding that the cuts were ""short sighted"". ""There will be a cost to the country, because these kids will need to access various things throughout their life, every professional will tell you that the earlier the intervention the better the outcome,"" she said. ""Stripping this away from some of the most vulnerable young people in our society is not the answer."" Last year each eligible child could access £2,500 for specialist assessment and £5,000 for therapy. But the therapy limit has now been cut to £3,000 per year, while separate funding for specialist assessment has been axed altogether. While the overall pot remains at £50m, increased demand means it is having to be shared among more families. Campaigners have said that many of these children rely on therapeutic support to help build secure attachments, increase self confidence, and to identify the necessary support functions needed to be put in place in education and family life. They fear the cuts will mean that therapy sessions could come to an abrupt end for some children if the money runs out and their families cannot afford to plug the gap. Alison Woodhead, from Adoption UK, said: ""These are kids who have been abused or neglected and these things have a lasting impact. ""The decision to cut this fund is just wrong"". A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We know how important this support is to families – and through our Plan for Change, we're committed to ensuring adopted and kinship families continue to receive the help they need to thrive."" It said that the Fair Access limit (FAL) has been set at £3,000 for 2025-26, in line with the average cost of services for most families, adding that more than half of therapy applications already fell within this limit in 2024-25.

174382,Teenagers admit torturing and killing kittens,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd900lx9ej9o,"Two teenagers have pleaded guilty to torturing and killing two kittens in Ruislip, west London. A police investigation began when a kitten was found hanging from a tree in a field near Ruislip Golf Club while the other was on the ground nearby on 3 May. The 16-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court and admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animals by ""mutilating and killing"" them. They also both admitted one count of possession of a knife at Ruislip Golf Course. The court heard the kittens were found with ropes attached to them and had been cut open. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in the dock flanked by security officers and spoke only to confirm their personal details. The court heard members of the public had seen the teenage boy in possession of an animal carrier and ""became concerned"" when they later saw him and the 16-year-old girl running from the scene. Knives, blowtorches and scissors were also found at the scene, the hearing was told. After the kittens were found, police appealed for information and released CCTV images of suspects and an image of a black bag believed to have been used to carry the animals. Two other teenagers, a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, arrested on Friday on suspicion of animal cruelty, were released without charge, the Metropolitan Police said.

452958,Struggling DNA testing firm 23andMe to be bought for $256m,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ln0e5g6kgo,"The DNA testing firm 23andMe says it has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256m (£192m). It comes two months after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. 23andMe said Regeneron had committed to comply with its privacy policies as part of the deal, and that Regeneron has security controls in place to protect user data. Last month, the firm agreed to have an ombudsman oversee the protection of user data in response to demands by several state attorneys general in the US. The officials expressed concern over the potential for unscrupulous buyers to wield the data against consumers. Regeneron will acquire nearly all of 23andMe's assets,the company said in a statement. Its subsidiary Lemonaid Health will be wound down under the agreement. 23andMe will continue to operate as a wholly-owned unit unit of Regeneron, which said it would use the firm's data for drug development. ""We are pleased to have reached a transaction that maximizes the value of the business and enables the mission of 23andMe to live on, while maintaining critical protections around customer privacy, choice and consent with respect to their genetic data,"" said 23andMe's board chairman Mark Jensen. The deal was made through auction last week as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. The company declined to comment further when approached by the BBC. Regeneron has different aims from the ones 23andMe presented to consumers, according to Dr Jennifer King, privacy and data policy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Dr. King, who has interviewed multiple 23andMe users for her research, said the company ""always led with the non-profit 'we're helping humanity' side which helped obscure its for-profit mission"". But she added a profit-driven mission was likely to be clearer to customersnow that it ""is in the sole control of a company that is doing genetic research for pharmaceutical development"". 23andMe was co-founded in 2006 by Anne Wojcicki who served as CEO until stepping down in March. Over the years, the company received high-profile endorsements from celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Snoop Dogg. 23andMe went public in 2021, which saw its value top $6bn - but it never turned a profit. The once-celebrated company has struggled amid weak demand for its testing kits and never managed to redefine its business model. A subscription service failed to gain traction with customers and efforts to use its massive trove of data to move into drug development also faltered. Then in 2023 the company experienced a data breach that exposed the genetic data of millions of users. The firm ultimately settled a lawsuit alleging it failed to protect the privacy of nearly seven million customers whose personal information was exposed. Hackers gained access to family trees, birth years and geographic locations, by using customers' old passwords, but the company maintains the data stolen did not include DNA records. Two months after the settlement, it slashed 200 jobs - about 40% of its workforce. Ms Wojcicki tried to take the company private but was not open to a third-party takeover. When 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March, attorneys general from multiple US states advised its customers to purge their information from the firm's database. At the time, the company said it would continue to protect customer data as laid out in its privacy policy, and any buyer of the company would have to abide by laws that apply to how customer data is treated. But its privacy policy also included language which allowed for personal information to be accessed, sold, or transferred if it was ""involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets"". 23andMe agreed to a court-appointed overseer of customer genetic data after several states alleged the company was failing to take data security seriously enough.

720990,Elton John brands government 'losers' over AI copyright plans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg0348yvxo,"Sir Elton John described the government as ""absolute losers"" and said he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws. Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"". This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes. A government spokesperson said that ""no changes"" to copyright laws would be ""considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators"". Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. Sir Elton said the ""danger"" is that, for young artists, ""they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]"". ""It's criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed,"" he added. ""The House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour,"" he said. ""The government just looked at it as if to say, 'Hmm, well the old people ... like me can afford it.'"" On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used. But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"", adding that he thought the government was ""just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it"". The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to ""wise up"" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as ""a bit of a moron"". He said if the government does not change its plans, he would be ready to take ministers to court, saying that ""we'll fight it all the way"". Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers ""do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way"". The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is ""on the brink"" of offering up the country's music industry ""as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants"". He added that the prime minister ""must not sell"" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators ""down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work"". Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joinedmore than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright lawsin a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter,previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a ""Wild West""in which artists' copyright was not properly protected. A government spokesperson said it wants the UK's creative industries and AI companies to ""flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors"". The spokesperson said it was ""vital"" the government worked through responses to a consultation on proposals to allow developers to use creators' content unless rights holders elected to ""opt out"". They added that it was ""equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps"". ""That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment - exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.""

923725,Workers optimistic but overwhelmed by AI - study,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpx1rl2nlo,"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workplace is both game-changing and overwhelming for UK workers, a study has found. More than 4,500 people from almost 30 different employment sectors were polled as part of the research, which was commissioned by Henley Business School. It found that 56% of full-time professionals were optimistic about AI advancements, while 61% said they were overwhelmed by the speed at which the technology developed. Prof Keiichi Nakata, from Henley Business School, said the study showed many workers ""don't feel equipped"" to use AI. Prof Nakata is director of AI at The World of Work Institute at the school, which is part of the University of Reading, and helps organisations get to grips with the technology. ""This wide-scale study offers a valuable snapshot of how AI is being adopted across UK industries - and where support is still lacking,"" he said. ""Without in-house training, hands-on learning, and clear policies, we risk creating a workforce that's willing to use AI but is not sure where to start."" The study found that three in five people polled said they would be more likely to use AI at work if proper training were available. But nearly a quarter of respondents said their employers currently were not providing enough support. Prof Nakata said the technology ""could be a transformative change in organisations across the UK"". He said AI could ""simplify complex tasks, take away the boring jobs, and enable workers to have more time to focus on the things that really matter"". ""But that's just the tip of the iceberg; it could prove to be a solution that not only helps businesses thrive but improves work satisfaction for employees,"" he added.

1066192,Melania Trump says new revenge porn law will protect children online,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74qnyz89y3o,"First Lady Melania Trump has joined her husband President Donald Trump as he signed a bill into law that makes posting so-called ""revenge porn"" and deepfake explicit content illegal. The Take It Down Act criminalises posting ""intimate images"" - real or AI-generated - online without an individual's consent and requires technology companies to remove the content within 48 hours. While the bill has received strong bipartisan support, some digital rights groups say  it's too broad and could lead to censorship. The first lady has championed the bill since her husband began his second term, arguing children need to be protected from ""mean-spirited and hurtful online behaviour"". The bill is the sixth piece of legislation Trump has signed in his second term, with the president often preferring to enact his agenda through Executive Orders. ""Anyone who intentionally distributes explicit images without the subject's consent will face up to three years in prison,"" Trump said. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previously said the Melania Trump was ""instrumental"" in getting the bill through Congress. The first lady, who rarely makes public appearances, described the new law as a ""national victory that will help parents and families protect children from online exploitation"". ""This legislation is a powerful step forward in our efforts to ensure that every American, especially young people, can feel better protected from their image or identity being abused,"" she added. It cleared the lower chamber of Congress in a 409-2 vote at the end of April, and was unanimously passed by the Senate in February. Melania Trump used her first solo public appearance to urge members of Congress to pass the bill in March. ""It's heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content, like deepfakes,"" the first lady said during a roundtable discussing the bill on 3 March. Revenge porn is sharing an intimate image without consent. Deepfake porn involves creating, often using AI, a fake explicit image or video of a person. Use of the technology has grown in recent years, allowing users to add the faces of celebrities or public figures - most often women - into pornographic films. The bill has been endorsed by Paris Hilton, the businesswoman and DJ,  who called it  ""a crucial step toward ending non-consensual image sharing online"". Tech companies including Meta, TikTok and Google also supported the legislation. But it's not without critics. Advocates for digital rights and free speech say it could lead to the censorship of legitimate content, including legal pornography, LGBT content, and government criticism. ""While protecting victims of these heinous privacy invasions is a legitimate goal, good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy,"" digital rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation said. ""As currently drafted, the Act mandates a notice-and-takedown system that threatens free expression, user privacy, and due process, without addressing the problem it claims to solve."" The Internet Society, which advocates for digital privacy on the internet, says it poses ""unacceptable risks to users' fundamental privacy rights and cybersecurity by undermining encryption"".

466184,Why we need 'revolutionary' cooling tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdzjev2d9wo,"Sneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up. Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling. Rising temperatures areeven worse for outdoor workers. ""This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,"" Ms Sachar says. She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow. For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as inwell-designed cooling stations, can make a difference. But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change. Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (£180bn) a year,could more than double by 2030. Yet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat. It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health. The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide. So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems. For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment. But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important. Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, ""A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so"". In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all. Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these ""revolutionary technologies"". A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress. Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because ""not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems"". RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices. One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields. ""With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,"" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm. The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process. The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. ""But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component."" The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices. Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. ""We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost."" He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies. Another technology under development is thermoelectric cooling. This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current. A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand. Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings. Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat. ""Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,"" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic. He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time. But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements. ""We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,"" says Mr Atti. Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. ""That's because there's zero moving parts,"" Ms Rasmussen explains. ""The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level."" In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise. A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress. Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys. At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is tobeat the energy efficiency of A/C. However, progress is continuing.A team led by Hong Kong researchersrecently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W—the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat. Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time. She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries. A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is ""Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?"" The goal of limiting warming to 1.5C is too high to avoid continued sea-level rise, scientists warn.

1098972,Peers demand more protection from AI for creatives,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39xj284e14o,"The House of Lords has dealt a second defeat to the government over its Data (Use and Access) Bill. Peers had already backed an amendment calling for more copyright protections for the creative industries from artificial intelligence (AI) scrapers once. MPs rejected that amendment and sent the Bill back to the Lords, where Technology Minister Baroness Jones told peers it would lead to ""piecemeal"" legislation as it pre-empted consultation on AI and copyright. However, there was broad and vociferous support for Baroness Kidron, a film director and digital rights campaigner, who accused ministers of being swayed by the ""whisperings of Silicon Valley"" asking them to ""redefine theft"". The Lords rebellion followscondemnation from Sir Elton John, who called the government ""losers"" over the weekend and said ministers would be ""committing theft"" if they allowed AI firms to use artists' content without paying. He joins the ranks of high-profile musicians, including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, and Kate Bush, who are outraged by plans they say would make it easier for AI models to be trained on copyrighted material. Kidron's amendment would force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, and demand they get permission from copyright holders before they use any of their work. Highlighting the power differential between the big tech giants in the US and creatives in the UK, Kidron branded the government's plans ""extraordinary"". ""There's no industrial sector in the UK that government policy requires to give its property or labour to another sector - which is in direct competition with it - on a compulsory basis, in the name of balance,"" she said. ""The government has got it wrong. ""They have been turned by the sweet whisperings of Silicon Valley who have stolen - and continue to steal every day we take no action - the UK's extraordinary, beautiful and valuable creative output. ""Silicon Valley has persuaded the government that it's easier for them to redefine theft than make them pay for what they have stolen."" Defending her amendment, the crossbench peer said it was ""the minimum viable action from the government"" to signal that ""UK copyright law is indeed the law of the land"". Otherwise, Kidron said, the Bill was merely a ""political gesture"" ignoring ""widespread theft"" of UK copyright and ""starving"" the creative industry of ""the transparency they need to survive"". She was backed by Labour's Lord Brennan, who said the government was trying to set up ""a double standard"" with AI companies, and abandoning its historical leadership over the importance of intellectual copyright. ""This country has shown leadership throughout history in relation to copyright and setting the highest standards in order to try and drag people up to our level rather than simply putting up the flag of surrender,"" he said. ""I fear there is a view that we have to allow AI companies to do anything they want because otherwise they'll just go and do it somewhere else."" Lord Watson, former deputy leader of the Labour Party and clearly a fan of Sir Elton, reeled off a string of song lyrics urging ministers to heed ""the clarion cry of this country's creators"". A third Labour peer, Lord Knight, also called on his party colleagues to ""protect the livelihoods of artists from big tech"" and said he believed this could be done at the same time as ""taking advantage of the creative and economic opportunities of AI"". The strength of feeling around the urgency to protect artists was made clear by others, including crossbencher and composer Lord Berkeley, who labelled the current situation ""burglary"". ""The only way you will stop it is by acting now before the gate is trampled down by the horses,"" he said. ""If this door is left open we will destroy the future of our creative industries."" Conservative Lord Dobbs agreed those who had ""slogged away, struggled and suffered"" for their art deserved the government's protection and Liberal Democrat Floella Benjamin said she saluted Kidron for her ""tenacity and dogged determination"" to ensure ""creativity will not be stolen"". Baroness Jones spoke again at the close of the debate to plead with peers not to overturn the will of MPs for a second time, insisting ""this isn't about Silicon Valley"", denying the government was being complacent, and pointing out that ""no other territory has cracked this either"". ""We all want to see a way forward that protects our creative industries while supporting everyone in the UK to develop and benefit from AI,"" she said. ""Kidron's amendment will not provide certainty of anything except for certainty of more uncertainty, of continuous regulations stacked one upon another in a pile of instruments... ""Jumping the gun on one issue will hamstring us in reaching the best outcome on all the others and especially because this is a global issue and we cannot ringfence the UK away from the rest of the world."" However, Kidron said her amendment ""does not challenge the primacy of the Commons"" and pushed ahead. The result was a decisive defeat for the Government, with 287 votes in favour of Kidron's amendment and 118 against - a majority of 169 - and the Bill will now be sent back to the Commons.

532181,UK weather forecast more accurate with Met Office supercomputer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg4ygerpjo,"The Met Office has unveiled a new supercomputer which it says produces better forecasts. The weather agency says detailed estimates up to 14 days in advance will become the norm, while rainfall predictions will also be more accurate. The new cloud-based system, which was launched on Monday, can perform 60 quadrillion calculations per second. It is being operated by Microsoft's cloud-based Azure, making it the first system the Met Office is not running by itself. And it ends a long wait for the weather prediction tech,which was first announced in 2020and originally slated for 2022. According to the Met Office, this is the world's first cloud-based supercomputer dedicated to weather and climate science. It said one of the benefits of the tech will be improving forecasting at airports, while it could also give the energy sector more detailed information to help it plan for potential blackouts and surges. And it said the supercomputer, which is entirely powered by renewable energy, will also improve predications on ongoing challenges caused by climate change, such as flooding and wildfires. The new supercomputer, which can perform more than four times the number of calculations per second than its predecessor, contains 1.8m core processors. While the exact location of the infrastructure is a secret, the Azure supercomputing service is physically located in the south of England and is split across two data centres. Afterrecent hacks of British institutionssuch as M&S and Co-op, cyber security is on ""everyone's thoughts"" according to the Met Office's chief information officer Charles Ewen. But he said he is happy with the security of the new system and is ""very confident this is a big enhancement"" on its predecessor. ""There's never been a more critical time for weather and climate intelligence,"" said Prof Simon Vosper, the Met Office's science director. ""We know the climate's changing, as we know the risks of hazardous weather. ""The supercomputer will unlock our ability to deliver those improved services where they're needed."" In February 2020, the UK governmentpledged £1.2bn for the projectand said the old supercomputers would reach the end of their lives in 2022. Mr Ewen said the three-year delay was predominantly caused by the Covid pandemic and its impact on the availability of silicon, while the Met Office highlighted the need to keep delivering existing services during the changeover. ""I'm very confident the Met Office is best placed in the world to be able to accommodate at scale emerging methods and techniques such as artificial intelligence,"" he said. Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service is one of the largest providers of data centres in the world, and powers a large part of artificial intelligence infrastructure.

1021007,Scientists in a race to discover why our Universe exists,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwvgevjjl6o,"Inside a laboratory nestled above the mist of the forests of South Dakota, scientists are searching for the answer to one of science's biggest questions: why does our Universe exist? They are in a race for the answer with a separate team of Japanese scientists – who are several years ahead. The current theory of how the Universe came into being can't explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies we see around us. Both teams are building detectors that study a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino in the hope of finding answers. The US-led international collaboration is hoping the answer lies deep underground, in the aptly named Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune). The scientists will travel 1,500 metres below the surface into three vast underground caverns. Such is the scale that construction crews and their bulldozers seem like  small plastic toys by comparison. The science director of this facility, Dr Jaret Heise describes the giant caves as ""cathedrals to science"". Dr Heise has been involved the construction of these caverns at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (Surf) for nearly ten years. They seal Dune off from the noise and radiation from the world above. Now, Dune is now ready for the next stage. ""We are poised to build the detector that will change our understanding of the Universe with instruments that will be deployed by a collaboration of more than 1,400 scientists from 35 countries who are eager to answer the question of why we exist,"" he says. When the Universe was created two kinds of particles were created: matter – from which stars, planets and everything around us are made – and, in equal amounts, antimatter, matter's exact opposite. Theoretically the two should have cancelled each other out, leaving nothing but a big burst of energy. And yet, here we – as matter – are. Scientists believe that the answer to understanding why matter won – and we exist – lies in studying a particle called the neutrino and its antimatter opposite, the anti-neutrino. They will be firing beams of both kinds of particles from deep underground in Illinois to the detectors at South Dakota, 800 miles away. This is because as they travel, neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change ever so slightly. The scientists want to find out whether those changes are different for the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. If they are, it could lead them to the answer of why matter and anti-matter don't cancel each other out. Dune is an international collaboration, involving 1,400 scientists from thirty countries. Among them is Dr Kate Shaw from Sussex University, who told me that the discoveries in store will be ""transformative"" to our understanding of the Universe and humanity's view of itself. ""It is really exciting that we are here now with the technology, with the engineering, with the computer software skills to really be able to attack these big questions,"" she said. Half a world away, Japanese scientists are using shining golden globes to search for the same answers. Gleaming in all its splendour it is like a temple to science, mirroring the cathedral in South Dakota 6,000 miles (9,650 km) away. The scientists are building Hyper-K - which will be a bigger and better version of their existing neutrino detector, Super-K. The Japanese-led team will be ready to turn on their neutrino beam in less than three years, several years earlier than the American project. Just like Dune, Hyper-K is an international collaboration. Dr Mark Scott of Imperial College, London believes his team is in pole position to make one of the biggest ever discoveries about the origin of the Universe. ""We switch on earlier and we have a larger detector, so we should have more sensitivity sooner than Dune,"" he says. Having both experiments running together means that scientists will learn more than they would with just one, but, he says, ""I would like to get there first!""  But Dr Linda Cremonesi, of Queen Mary University of London, who works for the Dune project, says that getting there first may not give the Japanese-led team the full picture of what is really going on. ""There is an element of a race, but Hyper K does not have yet all of the ingredients that they need to understand if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently."" The race may be on, but the first results are only expected in a few years' time. The question of just what happened at the beginning of time to bring us into existence remains a mystery – for now.

1014766,"Boy, 11, becomes piano prodigy by watching YouTube",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rekvx8r0do,"An 11-year-old boy who taught himself to play the piano in five months by watching YouTube videos has been invited to a prestigious music school. Harvey, from Stoke Ferry, near Downham Market, Norfolk, only started playing at the end of last year, but has already reached the advanced grade eight standard, according to his teacher. Videos of him playing have been posted online by his mother Jen and have gained thousands of views. The Royal Academy of Musichas invited him in for an induction day, to spend time with professionals to explore what he can do with his talent. Harvey said he started to play the piano because he found learning the music ""satisfying"". He has performed at the care home where his mother works and on public pianos at railway stations. ""It is really nice when you get applause from people. It makes you feel like your performance has been accepted,"" he said. Jen said he had not inherited his ability from her, joking that while she could play ""Chopsticks"", she would not describe herself as musical. ""He's taught himself off YouTube,"" she said. ""[He has] just decided 'Yes, that's what I want to play' and since then, he's on there for hours a day"". Jen said she was very proud of Harvey and keen to explore what his musical talent might mean for his future. Previously he had been very interested in computers and design but she said his pivot to playing music was a surprise. Harvey has just started lessons at formal lessons at The Norfolk Academy of Music. His teacher Bekki Smith said Harvey was already playing at the top Grade Eight level.

399467,Can AI therapists really be an alternative to human help?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ced2ywg7246o,"Listen to this article ""Whenever I was struggling, if it was going to be a really bad day, I could then start to chat to one of these bots, and it was like [having] a cheerleader, someone who's going to give you some good vibes for the day. ""I've got this encouraging external voice going – 'right - what are we going to do [today]?' Like an imaginary friend, essentially."" For months, Kelly spent up to three hours a day speaking to online ""chatbots"" created using artificial intelligence (AI), exchanging hundreds of messages. At the time, Kelly was on a waiting list for traditional NHS talking therapy to discuss issues with anxiety, low self-esteem and a relationship breakdown. She says interacting with chatbots on character.ai got her through a really dark period, as they gave her coping strategies and were available for 24 hours a day. ""I'm not from an openly emotional family - if you had a problem, you just got on with it. ""The fact that this is not a real person is so much easier to handle."" People around the world have shared their private thoughts and experiences with AI chatbots, even though they are widely acknowledged as inferior to seeking professional advice. Character.ai itself tells its users: ""This is an AI chatbot and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction. What is said should not be relied upon as fact or advice."" But in extreme examples chatbots have been accused of giving harmful advice. Character.ai is currently the subject of legal action from a mother whose 14-year-old son took his own life after reportedly becoming obsessed with one of its AI characters. According to transcripts of their chats in court filings he discussed ending his life with the chatbot. In a final conversation he told the chatbot he was ""coming home"" - and it allegedly encouraged him to do so ""as soon as possible"". Character.ai has denied the suit's allegations. And in 2023, the National Eating Disorder Association replaced its live helpline with a chatbot, but later had to suspend it over claims the bot was recommending calorie restriction. In April 2024 alone, nearly 426,000 mental health referrals were made in England - a rise of 40% in five years. An estimated one million people are also waiting to access mental health services, and private therapy can be prohibitively expensive (costs vary greatly, but the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reports on average people spend £40 to £50 an hour). At the same time, AI has revolutionised healthcare in many ways, including helping to screen, diagnose and triage patients. There is a huge spectrum of chatbots, and about 30 local NHS services now use one called Wysa. Experts express concerns about chatbots around potential biases and limitations, lack of safeguarding and the security of users' information. But some believe that if specialist human help is not easily available, chatbots can be a help. So with NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution? Character.ai and other bots such as Chat GPT are based on ""large language models"" of artificial intelligence. These are trained on vast amounts of data – whether that's websites, articles, books or blog posts - to predict the next word in a sequence. From here, they predict and generate human-like text and interactions. The way mental health chatbots are created varies, but they can be trained in practices such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps users to explore how to reframe their thoughts and actions. They can also adapt to the end user's preferences and feedback. Hamed Haddadi, professor of human-centred systems at Imperial College London, likens these chatbots to an ""inexperienced therapist"", and points out that humans with decades of experience will be able to engage and ""read"" their patient based on many things, while bots are forced to go on text alone. ""They [therapists] look at various other clues from your clothes and your behaviour and your actions and the way you look and your body language and all of that. And it's very difficult to embed these things in chatbots."" Another potential problem, says Prof Haddadi, is that chatbots can be trained to keep you engaged, and to be supportive, ""so even if you say harmful content, it will probably cooperate with you"". This is sometimes referred to as a 'Yes Man' issue, in that they are often very agreeable. And as with other forms of AI, biases can be inherent in the model because they reflect the prejudices of the data they are trained on. Prof Haddadi points out counsellors and psychologists don't tend to keep transcripts from their patient interactions, so chatbots don't have many ""real-life"" sessions to train from. Therefore, he says they are not likely to have enough training data, and what they do access may have biases built into it which are highly situational. ""Based on where you get your training data from, your situation will completely change. ""Even in the restricted geographic area of London, a psychiatrist who is used to dealing with patients in Chelsea might really struggle to open a new office in Peckham dealing with those issues, because he or she just doesn't have enough training data with those users,"" he says. Philosopher Dr Paula Boddington, who has written a textbook on AI Ethics, agrees that in-built biases are a problem. ""A big issue would be any biases or underlying assumptions built into the therapy model."" ""Biases include general models of what constitutes mental health and good functioning in daily life, such as independence, autonomy, relationships with others,"" she says. Lack of cultural context is another issue – Dr Boddington cites an example of how she was living in Australia when Princess Diana died, and people did not understand why she was upset. ""These kinds of things really make me wonder about the human connection that is so often needed in counselling,"" she says. ""Sometimes just being there with someone is all that is needed, but that is of course only achieved by someone who is also an embodied, living, breathing human being."" Kelly ultimately started to find responses the chatbot gave unsatisfying. ""Sometimes you get a bit frustrated. If they don't know how to deal with something, they'll just sort of say the same sentence, and you realise there's not really anywhere to go with it."" At times ""it was like hitting a brick wall"". ""It would be relationship things that I'd probably previously gone into, but I guess I hadn't used the right phrasing […] and it just didn't want to get in depth."" A Character.AI spokesperson said ""for any Characters created by users with the words 'psychologist', 'therapist,' 'doctor,' or other similar terms in their names, we have language making it clear that users should not rely on these Characters for any type of professional advice"". For some users chatbots have been invaluable when they have been at their lowest. Nicholas has autism, anxiety, OCD, and says he has always experienced depression. He found face-to-face support dried up once he reached adulthood: ""When you turn 18, it's as if support pretty much stops, so I haven't seen an actual human therapist in years."" He tried to take his own life last autumn, and since then he says he has been on a NHS waitlist. ""My partner and I have been up to the doctor's surgery a few times, to try to get it [talking therapy] quicker. The GP has put in a referral [to see a human counsellor] but I haven't even had a letter off the mental health service where I live."" While Nicholas is chasing in-person support, he has found using Wysa has some benefits. ""As someone with autism, I'm not particularly great with interaction in person. [I find] speaking to a computer is much better."" The app allows patients to self-refer for mental health support, and offers tools and coping strategies such as a chat function, breathing exercises and guided meditation while they wait to be seen by a human therapist, and can also be used as a standalone self-help tool. Wysa stresses that its service is designed for people experiencing low mood, stress or anxiety rather than abuse and severe mental health conditions. It has in-built crisis and escalation pathways whereby users are signposted to helplines or can send for help directly if they show signs of self-harm or suicidal ideation. For people with suicidal thoughts, human counsellors on the free Samaritans helpline are available 24/7. Nicholas also experiences sleep deprivation, so finds it helpful if support is available at times when friends and family are asleep. ""There was one time in the night when I was feeling really down. I messaged the app and said 'I don't know if I want to be here anymore.' It came back saying 'Nick, you are valued. People love you'. ""It was so empathetic, it gave a response that you'd think was from a human that you've known for years […] And it did make me feel valued."" His experiences chime with a recent study by Dartmouth College researchers looking at the impact of chatbots on people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or an eating disorder, versus a control group with the same conditions. After four weeks, bot users showed significant reductions in their symptoms – including a 51% reduction in depressive symptoms - and reported a level of trust and collaboration akin to a human therapist. Despite this, the study's senior author commented there is no replacement for in-person care. Aside from the debate around the value of their advice, there are also wider concerns about security and privacy, and whether the technology could be monetised. ""There's that little niggle of doubt that says, 'oh, what if someone takes the things that you're saying in therapy and then tries to blackmail you with them?',"" says Kelly. Psychologist Ian MacRae specialises in emerging technologies, and warns ""some people are placing a lot of trust in these [bots] without it being necessarily earned"". ""Personally, I would never put any of my personal information, especially health, psychological information, into one of these large language models that's just hoovering up an absolute tonne of data, and you're not entirely sure how it's being used, what you're consenting to."" ""It's not to say in the future, there couldn't be tools like this that are private, well tested […] but I just don't think we're in the place yet where we have any of that evidence to show that a general purpose chatbot can be a good therapist,"" Mr MacRae says. Wysa's managing director, John Tench, says Wysa does not collect any personally identifiable information, and users are not required to register or share personal data to use Wysa. ""Conversation data may occasionally be reviewed in anonymised form to help improve the quality of Wysa's AI responses, but no information that could identify a user is collected or stored. In addition, Wysa has data processing agreements in place with external AI providers to ensure that no user conversations are used to train third-party large language models."" Kelly feels chatbots cannot currently fully replace a human therapist. ""It's a wild roulette out there in AI world, you don't really know what you're getting."" ""AI support can be a helpful first step, but it's not a substitute for professional care,"" agrees Mr Tench. And the public are largely unconvinced. A YouGov survey found just 12% of the public think AI chatbots would make a good therapist. But with the right safeguards, some feel chatbots could be a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system. John, who has an anxiety disorder, says he has been on the waitlist for a human therapist for nine months. He has been using Wysa two or three times a week. ""There is not a lot of help out there at the moment, so you clutch at straws."" ""[It] is a stop gap to these huge waiting lists… to get people a tool while they are waiting to talk to a healthcare professional.""

985492,"Cyber attack threat keeps me awake at night, bank boss says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3372vl3yo,"The boss of one of the UK's biggest banks has said the threat of cyber attacks ""keeps me awake at night"". Ian Stuart, the CEO of HSBC UK, said cyber security was ""top of the agenda"" for his banking group, and dealing with IT vulnerabilities was an ""enormous"" expense for the sector as a whole. He said: ""It does worry me - we can be attacked and we are being attacked all the time."" Mr Stuart and other bank bosses have been speaking to the Commons Treasury Committee which has been taking evidence on a range of issues affecting the industry, including how vulnerable it is to outages and cyber attacks. In March, it emergednine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours- the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years. In recent weeks, retailers Co-op and Marks and Spencer have experienced severe disruption after being targeted by hackers. Lisa Forte, of the cyber security company Red Goat, told BBC News that Mr Stuart had made ""an incredibly important point"". ""Cyber attacks are increasing in both number and severity,"" she said. ""Criminals are monetising attacks more efficiently and we are at a point now where it very much is when not if businesses will experience an attack."" Mr Stuart said his banking group was spending hundreds of millions of pounds improving its IT systems. ""I think the amount of money banks - all of us - will be putting into our systems is enormous,"" he said. ""The defence mechanisms you put in are absolutely critical."" Across his group, he said they are processing 1000 payments a second while making 8000 IT changes and updates every week. Prof Oli Buckley, a cyber security expert at Loughborough University, said cyber attacks on financial institutions were ""relentless"" and ""increasingly sophisticated"". ""Ian Stuart is definitely right to highlight cyber security as a major concern for the banking sector, but recent events within retail have been a stark reminder that it can impact every sector,"" he added. ""It goes beyond just protecting customer data, it's about maintaining trust in the entire financial system. A breach doesn't just risk individual accounts; it can ripple through markets, reputations, public confidence and beyond."" Barclays, Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, NatWest, Danske Bank, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank have also provided information to the committee. Between January 2023 and February this year, they experienced 158 IT failures between them. Vim Maru, CEO of Barclays, addressed MPS about theBarclays outage which occurred on what was January pay dayfor many people. Serious IT problems affected online banking for several days, left some people unable to move home - and could result in the bank facing compensation payments of£12.5m, a report has found. Mr Maru apologised to customers, saying he was ""deeply sorry for the disruption"". He said there was no evidence it was caused a cyber incident or a malicious act. Following the Barclays incident in January, about 1.2m people in the UK were then affected by further banking outages in February. Those problems occurred at Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC.

327754,Fortnite faces complaint from actors' union over AI Darth Vader,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn844l3eznqo,"Actor union Sag-Aftra has filed a complaint over the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to recreate the voice of Star Wars villain Darth Vader in Fortnite. The union said Llama Productions - a subsidiary of Epic, which makes the hit video game - had chosen ""to replace the work of human performers with AI technology"". It has alleged the company did so without informing the union of its intentions or bargaining over terms. The BBC has approached Epic Games for comment. The union'sUnfair Labour Practice complaint, filed to the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleges that the company made ""unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilising AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work"". It said this amounted to a failure by the employer to ""bargain in good faith"". In the game, players can fight against Darth Vader, recruit the character to their team and interact with it. ""Strategise with the ultimate Sith Lord. With your voice. And he'll respond back using conversational AI,"" the company wrotein an announcementon Friday. It said its AI voice recreation of the Star Wars villain would not have been possible, nor ""nearly as sinister"" without the agreement of the estate of James Earl Jones - the late actor who voiced Darth Vader in the film franchise. An attached statement from the actor's family said he ""felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars"" and ""always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it"". ""We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character,"" they added. Sag-Aftra said it welcomed its members and their estate exercising their right to control how digital replicas are used - but wanted to be involved so actors more widely could benefit. ""We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games,"" it said. The complaint comes against the backdrop of video game and voice actors growing increasingly concerned over the use of AI to reduce their work or replace them altogether. Hollywood actors such as Scarlett Johansson have also highlighted concerns overhow their digital likeness could be manipulated using generative AI. Sag-Aftra, which represents actors across gaming, film, television and radio, has been continuing to try and reach agreements on terms around video game voice actors rights sincestrikes began last year. Voice actors connected to the SAG-Aftra union have been refusing to work with companies like Activision, Disney, Warner Bros and EA since July over issues such as the use of generative artificial intelligence. These included assurances over the use of digital replicas in video games. There are also worries the AI-powered tech could be misused. Wiredreportedthat Fortnite players were already finding ways to make Darth Vader's character swear in voice chats. With NHS mental health waitlists at record highs, are chatbots a possible solution? MPs have already overturned calls for more copyright protection for artists against AI once before. The research, commissioned by Henley Business School, polled more than 4,500 people. The musician accuses the government of robbing young artists over its copyright law plans. The centre opened at University of Wolverhampton on Friday to research cyber resilience and AI growth.

944778,A letter from the M&S hackers landed in my inbox - this is what happened next,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5nen5gxyo,"Almost daily, my phone pings with messages from hackers of all stripes. The good, the bad, the not-so-sure. I've been reporting on cyber security for more than a decade, so I know that many of them like to talk about their hacks, findings and escapades. About 99% of these conversations stay firmly locked in my chat logs and don't lead to news stories. But a recent ping was impossible to ignore. ""Hey. This is Joe Tidy from the BBC reporting on this Co-op news, correct?"" the hackers messaged me on Telegram. ""We have some news for you,"" they teased. When I cautiously asked what this was, the people behind the Telegram account - which had no name or profile picture - gave me the inside track on what they claimed to have done to M&S and the Co-op, in cyber attacks that caused mass disruption. Through messages back-and-forth over the next five hours, it became clear to me that these apparent hackers were fluent English speakers and although they claimed to be messengers, it was obvious they were closely linked to - if not intimately involved in - the M&S and Co-op hacks. They shared evidence proving that they had stolen a huge amount of private customer and employee information. I checked out a sample of the data they had given me - and then securely deleted it. They were clearly frustrated that Co-op wasn't giving in to their ransom demands but wouldn't say how much money in Bitcoin they were demanding of the retailer in exchange for the promise that they wouldn't sell or give away the stolen data. After a conversation with the BBC's Editorial Policy team, we decided that it was in the public interest to report that they had provided us with evidence proving that they were responsible for the hack. I quickly contacted the press team at the Co-op for comment, and within minutes the firm, who had initially downplayed the hack, admitted to employees, customers and the stock market about the significant data breach. Much later, the hackers sent me a long angry and offensive letter about Co-op's response to their hack and subsequent extortion, which revealed that the retailer narrowly dodged a more severe hack by intervening in the chaotic minutes after its computersystems were infiltrated.The letter and conversation with the hackers confirmed what experts in the cyber security world had been saying since this wave of attacks on retailers began – the hackers were from a cyber crime service called DragonForce. Who are DragonForce, you might be asking? Based on our conversations with the hackers and wider knowledge, we have some clues. DragonForce offers cyber criminal affiliates various services on their darknet site in exchange for a 20% cut of any ransoms collected. Anyone can sign up and use their malicious software to scramble a victim's data or use their darknet website for their public extortion. This has become the norm in organised cyber crime; it's known as ransomware-as-a-service. The most infamous of recent times has been a service called LockBit, but this is all but defunct now partly because it was cracked by the police last year. Following the dismantling of such groups, a power vacuum has emerged. Cue a tussle for dominance in this underground world, leading to some rival groups innovating their offerings. DragonForce recently rebranded itself as a cartel offering even more options to hackers including 24/7 customer support, for example. The group had been advertising its wider offering since at least early 2024 and has been actively targeting organisations since 2023, according to cyber experts like Hannah Baumgaertner, Head of Research at Silobreaker, a cyber risk protection company. ""DragonForce's latest model includes features such as administration and client panels, encryption and ransomware negotiation tools, and more,"" Ms Baumgaertner said. As a stark illustration of the power-struggle, DragonForce's darknet website was recently hacked and defaced by a rival gang called RansomHub, before re-emerging about a week ago. ""Behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling - that might be for prime 'leader' position or just to disrupt other groups in order to take more of the victim share,"" said Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher from the cyber security company Sophos. DragonForce's prolific modus operandi is to post about its victims, as it has done 168 times since December 2024 - a London accountancy firm, an Illinois steel maker, an Egyptian investment firm are all included. Yet so far, DragonForce has remained silent about the retail attacks. Normally radio silence about attacks indicates that a victim organisation has paid the hackers to keep quiet. As neither DragonForce, Co-op nor M&S have commented on this point, we don't know what might be happening behind the scenes. Establishing who the people are behind DragonForce is tricky, and it's not known where they are located. When I asked their Telegram account about this, I didn't get an answer. Although the hackers didn't tell me explicitly that they were behind the recent hacks on M&S and Harrods, they confirmed a report in Bloomberg that spelt it out. Of course, they are criminals and could be lying. Some researchers say DragonForce are based in Malaysia, while others say Russia, where many of these groups are thought to be located.  We do know that DragonForce has no specific targets or agenda other than making money. And if DragonForce is just the service for other criminals to use – who is pulling the strings and choosing to attack UK retailers? In the early stages of the M&S hack, unknown sources told cyber news site Bleeping Computer that evidence is pointing to a loose collective of cyber criminals known as Scattered Spider - but this has yet to be confirmed by the police. Scattered Spider is not really a group in the normal sense of the word. It's more of a community which organises across sites like Discord, Telegram and forums – hence the description ""scattered"" which was given to them by cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike. They are known to be English-speaking and probably in the UK and the US and young – in some cases teenagers. We know this from researchers and previous arrests. In November the US charged five men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One of them is 22-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based. Crackdowns by police seem to have had little effect on the hackers' determination, though. On Thursday, Google's cyber security division issued warnings that it was starting to see Scattered Spider-like attacks on US retailers now too. As for the hackers I spoke to on Telegram, they declined to answer whether or not they were Scattered Spider. ""We won't answer that question"" is all they said. Perhaps in a nod to the immaturity and attention-seeking nature of the hackers, two of them said they wanted to be known as ""Raymond Reddington"" and ""Dembe Zuma"" after characters from US crime thriller The Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a blacklist. In a message to me, they boasted: ""We're putting UK retailers on the Blacklist."" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

291294,UK driverless cars coming in 2027 - but Uber says it's ready now,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg80j771zo,"Uber has said it is ""ready to go"" now with driverless taxis in the UK - but the government has put back the date it expects to approve fully self-driving vehicles. Theprevious administrationsaid fully autonomous cars were ""set to be on roads by 2026"", but the new government says it is now more likely to happen in the second half of 2027. While limitedself-driving technology is already permitted on UK roads, a human driver must be at the wheel and responsible for the vehicle, even if automated technology is being used. Withsome companies trialling more advanced tech on British streets, I took an automated car ride across central London in a car using a system developed by UK AI firm Wayve. ""We're ready to launch robotaxis in the UK as soon as the regulatory environment is ready for us,"" said Andrew Macdonald, senior vice president of mobility at Uber, who joined me for the ride. The ride-hailing firm is working with 18 automated car tech companies including Wayve. It is one of several companies which already offers robotaxis in the US. They are also on the roads in China, the UAE and Singapore. But Mr Macdonald disagreed that the UK was behind the rest of the world, arguing that the US and China were ahead largely because that is where the majority of the tech had been developed. ""We are working quickly and will implement self-driving vehicle legislation in the second half of 2027"", the Department for Transport said in a statement. ""We are also exploring options for short-term trials and pilots to create the right conditions for a thriving self-driving sector,"" it added. In the US, Mr Macdonald said robotaxis typically operate for 20 hours per day, seven days per week. Even though there is no driver to pay, Uber says the fare is currently the same as a ride with a human behind the wheel. The option to take one appears on the app if one is available, and customers can opt in or out. That's partly because, aside from the regulatory environment, another potential barrier to their uptake is the public's reticence about travelling in a self-driving vehicle. A poll by YouGov in 2024suggested that 37% of Brits would feel ""very unsafe"" travelling in a car without a driver. But Mr Macdonald insisted new customers' initial nervousness was short-lived and the experience soon ""becomes the new normal"". That was certainly my experience during our ride. I was in a Ford Mach-e, fitted with Wayve's autonomous driving sensors and software. It uses a radar and seven cameras. In the boot there's is a computer which is running the AI-driven software that processes all that sensor data in real time and controls the car's responses. The automated tech handled every scenario without a hitch, including pedestrians in the road, parked cars, heavy traffic, temporary traffic lights and delivery bikes. George, our safety driver, did not touch the controls once and a big red button, which shuts off the automated system immediately, was not deployed. If anything the robo-ride was a far more patient city driver than I am – and has no voice, making it a lot less chatty. Whether autonomous vehicles are more or less safe than human-driven ones is still being investigated. But numerous studies suggest that automated vehicles are less accident-prone than human drivers, based on US data. But there have been a number of incidents involving robotaxis in the countries where they operate, ranging from road accidents to passengers being locked in. In January, a man in Arizona, in the US, documented how hisrobotaxi drove round in circlesin an airport carpark, with him trapped in the vehicle, unable to stop the car or get help. General Motors paused its driverless taxi service Cruise in San Francisco in 2023 because of safety concerns. ""The reality is that one accident is too many,"" said Uber'sMr Macdonald. ""That said, with EV (electric vehicles), human drivers… we operate in the real world and stuff happens."" In the UK there are also practical questions around insurance, ownership and liability when a self-driving vehicle is involved in an accident. Mr Macdonald said they were all still being worked out. Tom Leggett, vehicle technology manager at Thatcham Research - an independent car safety centre - said robotaxis would have to be ""safety-led"" in the UK. ""Secondly, they will have to make sure the data is available to those who need it – insurers and those investigating incidents when they occur."" The government says self-driving vehicles have the potential ""to build an industry worth £42bn and provide 38,000 jobs by 2035."" But of course they are source of concern for people who earn a living driving. Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary, said the ""significant social implications"" driverless cars and taxis could have - such as potential less work or unemployment - for workers and the public must be fully considered. Uber's Mr Macdonald meanwhile believes automated vehicles will transform the way many people travel in the near future. ""I've got young kids,"" he said. ""Do I think my daughters will necessarily get their drivers licences when they turn 16?"" [the legal age in his home country, Canada]. ""No – I think the world is changing a lot.""

862433,Starmer banks on public being over Brexit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2r4n871xo,"This is undeniably a significant deal. In a funny way, though, for Sir Keir Starmer to succeed he needs it to seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible. For many in politics, wading through the details of this agreement will be an act of nostalgia – or perhaps deeply triggering. Dynamic alignment. Sanitary and phytosanitary checks. Fishing quotas. Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. These are concepts, institutions and trade-offs which came to dominate British politics for much of the past decade. And with good reason: as the UK navigated its divorce with the EU, these technical questions became deeply political as they shaped the post-Brexit relationship. Sir Keir's big bet is that nobody really cares any more. In the press conference with EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, the prime minister talked about moving on from the ""stale old debates"" of the Brexit years. It's worth remembering too that the 2016 referendum was not the only political mandate delivered on this issue, and that Labour's general election manifesto last year promised an ""improvement"" to the Brexit deal. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union – but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. Of course pragmatism lies in the eyes of the beholder. The Conservatives have lambasted the deal as ""surrender"", attacking both the 12-year extension to existing fishing quotas and the commitment for the UK to follow EU rules on agriculture. Reform UK, in many ways the successor to the Brexit Party and UKIP, are unsurprisingly making a similar argument. On the other side of the equation, the Liberal Democrats welcomed ""some positive first steps"" but urged the prime minister to ""be more ambitious"". Their position is that the UK should rejoin the EU's customs union - an agreement between member states not to charge tariffs on each other's goods. What will prove revealing over the coming days, weeks, and months is not just those opposition parties' positions but how much they campaign on them. If opposition to today's deal becomes a significant part of these parties' platforms, it will tell us that they believe there is in fact plenty of controversy yet in the decades-long debate over the UK's relationship with the EU. If that's right, then today's main significance may prove to have been thrusting questions about Brexit right back to the centre of political life. But if Sir Keir is right that the bulk of the public simply wants as little friction with the EU as possible, then he could prove to be our first truly post-Brexit prime minister.

244595,Ryanair tells flight attendants to repay salary rises,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqeelw04e9o,"Ryanair has ordered some flight attendants in Spain to repay salary increases of up to €3,000 (£2,525) following a legal dispute with their union. A pay rise had been agreed with the Spanish union, CCOO, and it applied to all flight attendants regardless of what union they belonged to. But another Spanish union - Union Sindical Obrera - won a court case in March to nullify the deal. The Irish airline has now written to Union Sindical Obrera to say it will be informing its members how much they owe. Union Sindical Obrera has hit back at Ryanair's decision to claw back five month's worth of pay rises, but the firm said: ""USO are complaining about pay cuts that result from their court case."" It added: ""Ryanair is complying with the court case that Union Sindical Obrera took to cut pay while it is under appeal."" The union told the BBC: ""We are working on finding the most adequate legal solution for the matter."" The union said it objected to the original agreement because those at the table negotiating were not authorised to do so for its members and ""legally couldn't sign that kind of agreement"". It said this is why it ""left the negotiations, after advising all other parties that the negotiations were irregular"". According to Union Sindical Obrera, the rises that Ryanair is demanding union members pay back range between €1,500 and €3,000. It said also said that members and non-members have had their salary reverted to what it was before the agreement was implemented. A spokesperson for Ryanair declined to answer questions on how many flight attendants it is pursuing or what will happen if they do not pay back the money. Since the court case which nullified the deal for all flight attendants, Ryanair has agreed a pay deal for staff who are members of the CCOO union. They will not be required to pay back the increase they received between October and March, despite that original agreement being declared null and void by the court. The Union Sindical Obrera said the airline has told the affected flight attendants ""that the money will be simply deducted from the payslip until the debt is paid"". It added that ""some of the non-aligned workers are not forced to pay the amount back"" but ""all Union Sindical Obrera delegates have been requested to return the money"". In a letter, Ryanair describes the union's decision to maintain the terms agreed under the original deal with the CCOO, which the Union Sindical Obrera fought to nullify, as ""farcical"". In a document seen by the BBC, Ryanair informs a flight attendant, who is a member of Union Sindical Obrera, that because they are not part of the deal agreed with the CCOO this has ""created an overpayment situation"". The airline tells the worker that based on its calculations they were ""overpaid"" nearly €3,000. It offers to let the flight attendant repay the money over a year by taking a sum out of their monthly salary. About 170,000 nurses, midwives, paramedics and other staff will receive the rise which includes an inflation guarantee. The number of workers on payrolls fell in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Brendan O'Meara appeared before a special sitting of Ennis District Court on Saturday. Staff at Bath and North East Somerset Council are facing a pay cut at the beginning of June BBC Verify examines why political pressure over public sector pay and industrial action has re-emerged.

654671,Brussels hails UK deal as 'new chapter' - but much is yet to be written,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4gwvezvvko,"""We're turning a page,"" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday after the bloc's first summit with the UK since Brexit. ""We're opening a new chapter."" It is not the first page that has been turned in the post-Brexit period, but it is potentially the most significant. The two sides have now struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas that are still up for negotiation. For Brussels, this negotiation was a chance to bring Britain – a major defence power – closer in a time of geopolitical turbulence. And to address what some member states see as irritating hangovers from Brexit. For years, there was a ""don't touch it"" mentality when it came to taking a broad look at the Brexit settlement, according to one EU diplomat. It all involved ""too much politics"" with fears it could all ""go wrong."" Remember, up until the2023 Windsor Framework agreement, London and Brussels were bogged down in a protracted dispute over trade arrangements for Northern Ireland. Then, in 2024, a new government won power in the UK - the more EU-friendly Labour Party. Officials in Brussels had long voiced exasperation – even distrust – with prior Conservative administrations, a party with a vocal Brexit-backing contingent. Some Brexit supporters are now castigating a deal that they say amounts to a sell-out of sovereignty to EU bureaucrats. Diplomats in Brussels, however, insist that this is a ""normalisation"" of relations between neighbours who still look at the world in a broadly similar way. That being said, there was evident satisfaction in EU circles about locking in fishing quotas for 12 years. When I checked with one diplomat about that detail, they initially replied with a smiley face emoji. Another said: ""The deal is balanced—arguably with favourable terms for the EU—and simply shows that splendid isolation is not an option in today's climate."" Of course, the EU will want to highlight its ""wins"" in a negotiation with a former member state who badly shook the bloc by leaving. Nevertheless, coastal countries - notably France – will be happy at not having to endure annual fish quota talks, for now. It was, in the end I'm told, quid pro quo. The EU got its fishing deal. In return, it'll be easier for UK businesses to export agri-food products – although that element hasn't been finalised. Also yet to be ironed out are theplans for youth mobility – which would allow young people to study or work more easily between Britain and the EU. That was a particularly important goal for countries like Germany, anxious to win better access to an English-speaking country with prestigious universities. Another key point for Berlin was the new defence and security partnership. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's unpredictable White House have ripped up the rules on European security. Time has been something of a healer – but the events of recent years have also created a sense of urgency. Better ties with Britain, which remains a major defence player, is a no-brainer – now more than ever – for mainland Europe as it tries to scale up investment and capabilities. Nations like Germany – which only recently hit the 2% Nato spending target – are acutely aware that they have been left exposed by the dramatic global developments of recent years. But, of course, most of this deal is an agreement in principle; a statement of intent on issues also ranging across cyber security, energy and migration. ""I think it's a good step,"" another EU diplomat told me. ""It's good to test the waters for practical cooperation and what can be done. Let's take it from there."" There is still a watchful wariness in Brussels about Britain's fraught and divisive debate about relations with the EU. All the specifics, which have yet to be negotiated, could stir up further political storms whether that's on political compromises or cost. This ""reset"" may not change the big fundamentals of Brexit - the UK remains out of the single market and customs union- but it does commit London and Brussels to doing a lot more talking as they try to fill the many gaps that lie within this long list of ambitions. That means there will be a greater volume of diplomatic traffic between the UK and the EU going forward. Doing more business with Brussels inevitably means doing more talking. In that regard, today is just the beginning. A food producer has said the new UK-EU deal will reduce paperwork for exporting goods. Eluned Morgan said she understood concerns, but that export capabilities would improve. A deal between the UK and European Union (EU) has been agreed at a post-Brexit leaders summit in London. The new agreement is set to affect sectors including fishing, agriculture, hospitality and defence. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer says his government has struck a post-Brexit agreement with the EU.

551228,The world's most dangerous country for trade unionists,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j715l2d6no,"In July last year, Jesús Cometa was shot at as he was driving through the Cauca Valley in southwest Colombia. Gunmen on motorbikes pulled up alongside his car and sprayed it with bullets. Mr Cometa escaped uninjured but his bodyguard was hit. ""He still has a bullet lodged in his chest,"" he says. Mr Cometa is one of thousands of trade unionists who have been attacked in recent years in Colombia which, by some measurements, is the most dangerous place in the world for organised labour. The Cauca Valley is home to the country's sugar industry, and he is a local representative of Sintrainagro, Colombia's largest agricultural trade union. ""When you take on these roles in the union, you lose your social life,"" Mr Cometa says. ""You can't just go and hang out in a crowded bar, or on a street corner, because you never know when you might be targeted. ""Your family suffers too because they know that they're also targets."" This is a problem with a long history. In his ground-breaking novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Colombia's Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel García Márquez famously highlighted the massacre of workers on banana plantations in the country in the 1920s. The Labour Ministry says that since the early 1970s, well over 3,000 trade unionists have been murdered in Colombia. And even though the nation is more peaceful than it once was, the attacks continue. ""For many years now already, unfortunately, Colombia is the deadliest country in the world for trade unionists and for trade union work,"" says Luc Triangle, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a global umbrella organization based in Brussels. Every year the ITUC publishes a survey of the atrocities carried out against trade unionists around the world. Its most recent edition covers the year to the end of March 2024. It found that in those 12 months, 22 trade unionists were killed for their activism around the world. Eleven of themwere murdered in Colombia. ""Generally, these are targeted murders,"" Mr Triangle says. ""They know what they are doing. They know who they want to murder. ""It's not targeting the big bosses of the trade unions or the leaders. They are targeting in small villages people that are doing active trade union work. ""Between 2020 and 2023, we recorded 45 murders in Colombia. In 2022, 29 murders. It's less violent than it once was, but it's still very violent, certainly if you compare it with other countries."" Why is this happening? Fabio Arias, the head of Colombia's largest trade union federation, the CUT, says it is all part of Colombia's long and complex civil conflict, which pitted left-wing rebel groups against right-wing paramilitaries, drug traffickers and the Colombian state, and which still rumbles on in some parts of the country. ""The trade union movement has always been linked to the parties of the left and unfortunately the many right-wing governments we've had in Colombia have always claimed that anyone who is a leftist is a guerrilla, a terrorist,"" Mr Arias says. ""And once you've established that, then people feel justified in attacking them."" He says the attacks on workers are also linked to Colombia's illegal economies, notably the cocaine trade and illegal mining. ""If you look at where these attacks are happening, it's in the departments of Cauca, Nariño, Putumayo, Arauca, Norte de Santander and Caquetá, because that's where the biggest coca plantations are, and where the illegal mining is."" It is not clear who is carrying out these killings and who is ordering them. Some trade unionists blame the private sector, saying businesses, desperate to stifle any attempt by workers to organize, are paying armed groups to carry out these atrocities. They point to the fact that threats and attacks tend to spike at times when businesses and unions are in wage negotiations. But as many of the attacks go unpunished, it is difficult to know who exactly is to blame. ""In the Cauca Valley there are so many different armed groups you never really know who's behind the attacks, who's carrying them out, who's ordering them,"" says Zenón Escobar, another sugar cane worker and local representative of Sintrainagro. The threats in the Cauca Valley are not limited to the sugar industry. ""In 2007, I was in a van, and guys drew up next to us on a motorbike and asked for me, and then opened fire,"" recalls Jimmy Núñez, the leader of a union that represents street traders in the regional capital Cali. ""My colleague who was sitting next to me was killed, and my wife was injured. In 2010 they attacked me again, on the road between Cauca and Cali. ""They opened fire on my car. In 2012 we were attacked in a shopping centre in Cali and one of us was killed. And in 2013 my family had to leave Cauca due to threats. ""In this country social leaders and trade union leaders are killed every day."" The government says it is doing what it can to protect trade unionists. Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, heads a left-wing administration that is broadly sympathetic to the country's workers. In 2023, it took a step towards redressing the past by formally recognizing the trade union movement – collectively, and for the first time – as a victim of Colombia's conflict. That gives victims a greater chance of having their cases investigated. ""We consider this as an important step to recognize the violence against trade unionists in Colombia, which was not the case before,"" says Luc Triangle of the ITUC. He also says foreign companies with operations in Colombia must do more. ""If I were the CEO of a multinational, I would question my activities in Colombia,"" he says. ""There is a huge responsibility for multinational companies. They cannot have a nice code of conduct, and at the same time remain silent when trade unionists are killed. ""That's not acceptable. Global companies and foreign investors in Colombia must step up."" Additional reporting by Immie Rhodes.

83562,Tesla battery maker sees shares jump in Hong Kong debut,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d4k1derzgo,"The world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker has seen its shares jump on their first day of trading in Hong Kong, as it made the biggest initial public offering (IPO) so far this year. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL) produces more than a third of all EV batteries sold worldwide and supplies major carmakers including Tesla, Volkswagen and Toyota. The listing was closely watched as the US-China tariff war upended the global trading system and hit carmakers hard. In January, the US Department of Defense added the battery maker to a list of businesses it says works with China's military. CATL denies this, claiming itsinclusion on the list was a ""mistake"". The company raised almost HK$35.7bn ($4.55bn: £3.4bn) from the listing, with its shares climbing by as much as 18%. ""The performance of the stock was very good in what is going to be a key IPO for Hong Kong given the size of the listing,"" said Neil Beveridge, head of research for Asia at Bernstein. CATL already trades on China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange, where it has a valuation of more than one trillion yuan ($138.7bn: £104.3bn). The firm is heavily reliant on the Chinese market, with the world's second largest economy accounting for almost 70% of its total revenue. Its relatively small sales to the US will ensure it is shielded from Trump's trade policies, said Mr Beveridge. ""The direct implications of what we are seeing with tariffs will only have a limited effect on the company,"" he told the BBC. Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, it enjoyed rapid growth thanks to the boom in the country's EV industry. The battery giant employs more than 100,000 people and has 13 production plants around the world. CATL is currently building its second European factory in Hungary, after opening a plant in Germany in early 2023. In December, the firm announced a tie-up with Chrysler-owner Stellantis to build a $4.3bn (£3.2bn) EV battery plant in Spain. The facility is set to be in operation by the end of next year. The firm invests heavily in new technology, with six research and development centres around the world. ""The innovations that we're seeing from CATL are unbelievable, particularly in the fast charging area,"" said Tim Buckley, founder of the independent Australian think tank Climate Energy Finance. Last month, the company unveiled a new battery that it said can be charged for 323 miles (520km) in just five minutes. CATL is a major supplier to Elon Musk's Tesla, providing lithium iron phosphate batteries for the EV maker's Shanghai factory. But US lawmakers have expressed concerns about potential national security risks surrounding the Chinese company. In April, the chair of the House Select Committee on China wrote letters to the chief executives of JPMorgan and Bank of America, asking them to withdraw from working on CATL's Hong Kong listing. Despite scepticism about Chinese firms from Washington, Mr Buckley says the US should be looking to work with Beijing on the advancement of renewable energy. ""They're rejecting by far the best technology players in the world when it comes to clean tech,"" he told the BBC.

490168,"UK-EU deal moves us on from Brexit rows, Starmer says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9v28r7vlxo,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said it is time to move on from ""political fights"" about Brexit, as the UK and the European Union agreed to a major reset of relations. The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation. A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions. It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit. The Conservatives and Reform UK have described the deal as a ""surrender"" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some ""positive first steps"" to rebuilding ties with Europe. The agreement was finalised late on Sunday, ahead of a summit involving EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in London on Monday. ""It's time to look forward,"" Sir Keir said at the summit. ""To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people. ""We're ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people's lives here at home."" At a news conference, European Commission President von der Leyen described the summit as a ""historic moment"" that was only possible ""thanks to the leadership"" of Sir Keir. ""We're turning a page,"" she said. ""We're opening a new chapter in our relationship."" The president said the deal would make ""a real difference to people in the UK and across our union"" at a time of global instability. The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks. Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely, the government said. In return, the UK will give the EU access to its fishing waters until 2038 - a 12-year extension of arrangements already in place. One diplomatic source said it amounted to a rollover of the existing terms agreed as part of the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in 2019. The text of the deal says: ""We note the political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038 and extending energy cooperation on a continuous basis."" The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights, which gave EU boats continued access to UK waters, was set to expire at the end of June 2026. The UK government has also unveiled a £360m investment fund in coastal communities and the fishing industry. Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.04% of UK GDP, but British control over its fishing waters was a big issue in the Brexit campaign. Defending the agreement, Sir Keir said it would allow British fishing communities to ""sell more easily into the European market"" and give them ""stability over the long term"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the 12-year deal on access for European boats ""will be the end of the fishing industry"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister ""must ignore the naysayers and dinosaurs in Reform and the Conservative Party and be more ambitious in getting the best deal in the national interest"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said giving the EU access to British waters for 12 years ""was three times longer than the government wanted"". ""We're becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again,"" she said. The deal requires the UK to follow rules set by Brussels in areas covering food trade, emissions trading and potential co-operation in the electricity market. Known as dynamic alignment, this arrangement would mean the UK giving the European Court of Justice a role in any trading disputes. Ina post on X, Johnson said under this ""sell out of a deal the UK will have to accept EU law on a host of measures from food standards to emissions trading"". He said Sir Keir had agreed that the UK ""will once again be paying countless millions of pounds into EU coffers - for the privilege of becoming the non-voting punk of the EU Commission"". The prime minister's spokesperson said payments to the EU in relation to the deals on agricultural products and energy were ""not big"", but not did confirm the costs. The government said there was a difference between these ""administrative costs"" and the payments required to be part of EU programmes, which would be part of future negotiations. A security pact is also central to the agreement, as European nations come under pressure to invest more in defence to support Ukraine as it faces Russia's full-scale invasion. The agreement paves the way for the UK to participate in the EU's proposed new £150bn defence fund, opening up opportunities for UK arms firms to bid for defence contracts. The government said British businesses will not be hit by an EU carbon tax due to come in next year, under plans to link emissions-trading schemes. The agreements on trade and energy would add nearly £9bn to the UK economy by 2040, the government estimated. Other announcements include: The reset comes after years of ill-tempered relations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, which triggered one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history. Since Labour took office last year, governments worldwide have been forced to rethink their relationships on trade and defence, in response to US President Donald Trump's policies and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ministers believe there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit – membership of the single market and customs union. Polling by YouGov suggests a majority of Britons now regret the Brexit vote and favour closer ties with the EU. But the Labour government's reset of EU relations comes at a time when Reform UK - a Eurosceptic party - is leading in the polls.

732760,The secretive US factory that lays bare the contradiction in Trump's America First plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj0zgzwxo,"Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world. The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips. It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC. Its Arizona facility ""Fab 21"" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing. They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products. But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world. President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. ""TSMC is the biggest there is,"" he has said. ""We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us."" This is one of the US president's regular refrains. TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (£75bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business. The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs. China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its ""Silicon Shield"", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk. China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland. So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy. He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world. Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. ""I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,"" he says. ""It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering."" Inside the ""Gowning Building"", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything. Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as ""4 nanometre chips"". ""This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,"" he explains. ""[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps."" If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers. TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful. Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence. It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of ""extreme ultraviolet (UV) light"". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called ""lithography"". The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona. These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors. The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed. ""Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,"" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. ""The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms."" Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life. Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies. He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim. Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act. On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying ""a future Made in America"". ""The semiconductor supply chain is global,"" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. ""There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly."" As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges. That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products. The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs. There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try and limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world. Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop ""non-Red"" supply chains to counter China. Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies ""have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead"". Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation. So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.

881383,What one of America's most lively sporting events says about the economy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk0zq7kg5o,"A woman balancing a dozen cocktails on a tray atop her head inched carefully through the steadily building crowds and chaos on Saturday morning at the Pimlico Race Course clubhouse. ""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. ""Twenty dollars,"" she replied. Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two."" He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. ""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on."" His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin. On the other side of Pimlico – just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield – five thoroughbreds idled behind the  starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment. ""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said. One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question. In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to historic consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes. Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market. Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"".  But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases. But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remain unclear. Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015. Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs. ""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald. Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. University of Kansas economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling could also be a sign of economic distress. ""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said. ""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release."" Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"". He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government. Mr Walker planned to gamble – ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" – but a bit less than he might have in more certain times. ""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy – the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life."" At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents. ""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness. To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning. ""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said. The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about was the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many. The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica. But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield. ""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube."" Though Pimlico always had offerings for the elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.) Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it. In his purple pants and every-colour-of-the-rainbow shirt, Mr De Rubin grew agitated as his luck began to unravel during the five-horse race. ""(Horse number five) is dead last. I don't think they're going to catch this,"" he said with growing animation, rattling the ice in his Black-Eyed Susan. He placed bets on horses one, three and five. ""Oh, (crap), the three horse. Here comes the one horse. Come on, one!"" In a span of about three minutes, the anticipation, anxiety, fear and hope all came crashing to an end. Mr De Rubin didn't win. But he didn't lose either. The even spread on the winning horse basically gave him back what he put into it. He compared the experience to today's seesaw stock market. ""Investing, and betting on horses, is gambling. You have ups and downs,"" he said. His stock portfolio has taken a wild downward spin through Trump's global tariff tit-for-tat. But recently it sprang back into the green and is up around 20%, he said. Unlike the horses, ""you can't watch the market. It'll give you a heart attack"", he advised. ""I have faith in Trump. He's a little crazy with it right now, but it'll all work out."" The news that he has ""aggressive"" prostate cancer has some medics asking why it was not detected sooner. ""We don't think it will lead to any outcome,"" the supreme leader warns, saying the US is making ""outrageous"" demands on uranium enrichment. Temporary Protected Status allows people to live and work in the US legally if their home countries are deemed to be unsafe.

59658,"New buy now, pay later rules aim to protect shoppers",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg5le8p25o,"The government has announced new rules aiming to protect shoppers using buy now, pay later services, saying it wants to end the ""wild west"" of unregulated borrowing. Under the legislation, lenders will have to carry out affordability checks to stop people taking on too much debt and shoppers will have faster access to refunds. The use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) has surged recently, with 11 million people in the UK estimated to have used it in the last year, but there have been fears some are spending more than they can afford. Consumer groups welcomed the move and said many users did not realise they were taking on debt they might struggle to repay. Under BNPL, rather than paying the full amount of a purchase in one go, shoppers can spread payments into smaller amounts over a short period of time, usually only weeks or months. For some people this can be a convenient way of spreading the cost of shopping, but there are fears some consumers could be taking on too much debt. BNPL products are currently unregulated and Citizens Advice said the new measures were a ""crucial step"" towards better protection for shoppers. ""For too long, people have been exposed to unaffordable debt from a BNPL sector that has operated in a regulatory grey area,"" said Tom MacInnes, director of policy at Citizens Advice. ""For some, this has had dire consequences. Many people are struggling to repay credit they can't afford, falling behind on essential bills and often needing emergency support, like food bank vouchers."" Measures to tighten oversight of the sector have been discussed for years, and the previous governmentunveiled plans in 2023. Under the new legislation, which is due to take effect next year, the government says BNPL firms will have to follow consistent standards so shoppers know what they are signing up to, whether they can afford the purchase and how to get help if needed. It says this means ""upfront"" checks on affordability, faster access to refunds, and the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. Emma Reynolds, economic secretary to the Treasury, said BNPL had ""transformed shopping for millions"", but had left consumers exposed and operated as a ""wild west"". ""These new rules will protect shoppers from debt traps and give the sector the certainty it needs to invest, grow, and create jobs,"" she added. Last week,a comprehensive survey by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found the number using BNPL had ""risen significantly"", climbing by two million in the past three years. It said 40% of lone parents and 35% of women aged between 25 and 34 use BNPL  products. Lisa Webb, consumer law expert at the Which? consumer association, said its research indicated ""many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments"". A spokesman for Klarna, one of the biggest suppliers of BNPL services in the UK, said the company had supported regulation for the sector since 2020. ""It's good to see progress on regulation, and we look forward to working with the FCA on rules to protect consumers and encourage innovation,"" he said. Another major BNPL provider, Clearpay, said it would ""support the FCA to deliver fit-for-purpose regulation that ensures consumer protection, provides much-needed innovation in consumer credit, and supports the UK's thriving FinTech sector"".

215089,The camera tech propelling shows like Adolescence,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62g6vdl3vqo,"Three strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting. We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail. Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van. All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than120 million people worldwidein its first month. It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimedin a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a ""oner"", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming. Lightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry. At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again. You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator – there's a minuscule wobble – but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless. It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects. This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage. The result is ""phenomenal"", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer. He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. ""As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take."" Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds. In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. ""It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,"" he recalls. Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes – but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence. Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated. He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. ""That's a complete game-changer,"" he says. Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades. Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some haveexpressed scepticismabout this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen tells the BBC emphatically, ""There are no edits or cuts."" While Mr Brandth Grøvlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional – the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones. ""It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,"" says Mr Brandth Grøvlen, ""You're taken on a journey."" He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Grøvlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve ""muscle memory"" of the process. ""When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle – that way it shakes a little bit less,"" he explains. The Ronin 4D is DJI's ""first dedicated cinema camera"", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm. He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal. There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming – increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok. Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most ""ideal"" solution, he acknowledges. Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models. Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests. The rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. ""Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,"" he says. ""It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories."" There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics. Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices. But fascination over ""oners"" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: ""Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take – I want to watch these things because they're good."" New trade agreements will boost economic growth, says chancellor, as she sets sights on Middle East. China's CATL makes more than a third of electric vehicle batteries sold worldwide and also supplies VW and Toyota.

418361,Sesame Street heads to Netflix after Trump pulled funding,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80k7z8z77yo,"Sesame Street and Netflix have struck a deal that will see the popular TV show appear on the streaming platform, after US President Donald Trump pulled funding for the free-to-air channel Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Netflix saidthe iconic programme is a ""beloved cornerstone of children's media, enchanting young minds and nurturing a love of learning"". Netflix will offer its 300 million subscribers a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes, and it will still also be available on PBS. Sesame Street was also facing an uncertain future after entertainment giant Warner Bros Discovery, which owns the HBO platform, did not renew its deal with the half a century old programme. Earlier this month, Trump issued an executive order to block federal funding  for PBS and the National Public Radio (NPR) network, alleging theyengaged in ""biased and partisan news coverage"". The government body Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which backed the two broadcasters, has sinceannounced the termination of a federal initiativewhich funded shows for children, including Sesame Street. Under the deal, PBS will get access to Sesame Street episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. In the late 1960s, Sesame Street co-founders Lloyd Morrisett and Joan Ganz Cooney approached Harvard University's Graduate School of Education with a novel way of teaching American children. A team led by a developmental psychologist worked with the Sesame founders to analyse childhood psychology and produce entertaining lessons. They worked with Muppets creator Jim Henson to create characters like Big Bird, with a set made to look like an urban street. Since its first airing on 10 November 1969, millions of children have grown up with the show's theme tune ""Can you tell me how to get, how get to Sesame Street?"" Over the decades, the programme and its characters have gained a life beyond the small screen. Popular character Elmo stepped into the public policy spotlight in 2002, when he was invited to discuss music education at Congress. During a child obesity epidemic in the US in 2006, Sesame Street aired Health Habits segments designed to teach kids about diet and exercise. The Cookie Monster declared cookies a ""sometimes food"" and taught children about a balanced diet. Former First Lady Michelle Obama also visited Sesame's studios to film a segment on healthy eating. Netflix has been increasing its focus on children's content, which accounts for 15% of viewing on its service. It also announced on Tuesday that new episodes of Peppa Pig and a mobile game with puzzles and colouring activities would be coming to the platform. The animated show is centred on the adventures of a four-year-old piglet called Peppa who lives with her family in a fictional British town. A scuffle broke out during a visit by Democratic lawmakers, but LaMonica McIver says the case against her is political. Government-funded welfare programmes have become a major point of contention in Trump's tax bill. The news that he has ""aggressive"" prostate cancer has some medics asking why it was not detected sooner. It follows Donald Trump saying Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately"" start negotiating, after a two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin.

618183,US debt downgrade drives up borrowing costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2j03w10gno,"Investors might have hoped the turmoil that hit financial markets last month was over. But another bout of volatility in US borrowing costs is a sign that worries continue to bubble. The interest rate on the US government's long-term debt surpassed the 5% on Monday, before retreating slightly. That was the highest level since October 2023. It came after Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating on Friday, citing the rising debt over the past decade. Congress is meanwhile advancing a tax-and-spending bill that would add trillions to the US government's $36tn in debt. When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - sometimes called Treasuries - to investors on financial markets. Investors buy the bond, providing the government with cash, and are typically repaid, plus interest over a number of pre-agreed years. Just as with a regular loan, bonds perceived to be risky have higher interest rates, also called yields. Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks such as the Bank of England. Some hold on to the bonds until the term of the loan expires, while others sell them to other investors. Historically, the US government has been shielded from having to pay high interest rates, because Treasuries have been considered safe. That is because the US economy has been strong, with stable prices, and the US government was considered a reliable partner, unlikely to default. The yields on 30-year Treasuries hovered around 3% for much of decade following the 2008 financial crisis. When it crossed 5% in October 2023, it was the first time it had hit that threshold in 16 years. The yield on 30-year Treasuries climbed to 5.04% on Monday, up from 4.9% on Friday before the downgrade, before falling back under the 5% mark. So what are the new risks? Yields started rising in 2021, as the US was hit by soaring prices after the Covid-19 pandemic. Concerns reignited last month, after President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs globally, which analysts said would hurt the economy and drive up prices. At the same time, the US has been running up its debt, with little sign of slowdown in sight. On Friday,Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating, citing the growing debt and little progress toward resolving it. The move was not unexpected. Moody's was the last of the three rating agencies to take the step and had warned in 2023 that this might happen. But the situation it described was underscored when part of Congress voted on Sunday to advance a tax bill that would add at least $3tn to US debt over the next decade. The ""Moody's downgrade is, effectively, a political assessment, as much as it is an economic one"", wrote Macquarie Bank analyst Thierry Wizman. ""The political and institutional breakdown - in regard to the US's lack of capacity to 'course correct', is the true meaning of the downgrade, rather than the high debt load itself."" According to Moody's, interest payments in the US are on a path to consume 30% of the federal government's revenue by 2035, compared with 9% in 2021. If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself. Just as importantly, interest rates for the government typically influence interest rates charged on other kinds of loans, such as mortgages or credit cards. So higher interest rates for the government mean higher interest rates for households and businesses, too. Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time. First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs. Guernsey's Institute of Directors says renting leaves people with little money left over. UK Inflation has fallen but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. Interest rates, set by the Bank of England, affect mortgage, loan and savings rates for millions. The Federal Reserve said Trump's barrage of tariffs were generating too much uncertainty to predict its next moves.

507976,US loses last perfect credit rating amid rising debt,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o,"The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt. In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs. A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts. Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917. The downgrade ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said in the statement. In a statement, the White House said it was ""focused on fixing Biden's mess"", while taking a swipe at Moody's. ""If Moody's had any credibility,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded."" A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs. Moody's maintained that the US ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency"". The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country. The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment. The downgrade came on the same day asTrump's landmark spending billsuffered a setback in Congress. Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it. Figures showed theUS economy shrank in the first three months of the yearas government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs. The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

1073472,Defence deals and palace invites: UK and EU haggle before first summit since Brexit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4r54kd8do,"""Don't expect miracles. But do know - everyone wants this to work."" On Monday in London the EU and UK hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit. Symbolically, this is a big moment. Officials and analysts I speak to, on and off the record, like the individual I just quoted, are quick to point out difficulties that exist between the two sides. But all acknowledge the bilateral bitterness provoked by Brexit is no more. It's been eviscerated by the gravity of global events. Concerns about Russia and China, the war in Ukraine,the shock of the US under Donald Trump no longer prioritising European defence,plus a growing sense of voter insecurity is propelling the two powers to work closer together. ""Failure to do so, in the current international context, would not be a good look,"" says Anand Menon, director of the think tank UK in a Changing Europe. Most European countries realise that, he adds: ""Even the French."" More than most EU countries, France has been playing hardball in pre-summit negotiations. Is it a coincidence that as talks went to the wire before Monday's summit, the UK announced thatFrance's president has been invited for his first state visit? King Charles and Queen Camilla will host Emmanuel Macron and his wife at Windsor Castle in July. A UK attempt to butter up the French leader, perhaps? ""It'll be interesting to see if they can agree common language [for a summit agreement],"" says Georgina Wright, Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund. ""Everyone in the EU wants closer relations with the UK right now and France doesn't want to be seen as the one country blocking closer UK-EU cooperation. But that does not mean that Paris is willing to give up on core interests."" Interests like fishing rights in UK waters and bidding for EU defence contracts. Negotiating - or to be more accurate - haggling over the ""meat"" of the summit will, I'm told, continue till the last moment. On the day itself, we can expect three separate announcements: These trade measures are the ""reset"" of relations with the EU that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised since his party won a general election last summer. They are far from an economic gamechanger for the UK, though. Hardly what you'd call ambitious. Destroying all trade barriers with the EU is impossible if the Labour government keeps to its own ""red lines"" of not rejoining the bloc's customs union or single market. Despite promising to prioritise UK economic growth, and polls suggesting the majority of Britons want to do more trade with the EU, Labour will feel hemmed in by the increasingly popular, Eurosceptic Reform Party. Itperformed well in recent local electionsin the UK. While some in Labour (quietly) admit they are tempted by a customs union with the EU to boost growth, any economic benefits would likely not be apparent to voters before the next UK election. Party members fear they would risk being punished at the polls, amidst accusations by the opposition Conservatives and Reform that the government would have betrayed Brexit. These concerns make the Starmer government ""more cautious, less bold"", says Mr Menon. The UK is taking a sector-by-sector approach to try to reduce costly trade barriers with the EU. Many EU-UK negotiating hours have gone into agreeing a plant and animal health deal, known as an SPS agreement. This will facilitate the export and import of meat and plant products between the EU and UK and help reduce post-Brexit trade complications between Northern Ireland and Britain. In exchange, the EU insists the UK must agree to following any new SPS rules introduced in the future and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in policing the agreement. Those conditions will likely be unpopular with ardent Brexit supporters. They might also put backs up in Washington andcomplicate the UK doing a wider future deal on agriculture with the US,as the UK would be tied to stringent EU standards. But the Labour government knows public opinion polls suggest most people in the UK prioritise trade with the EU over the US. Currently the EU counts for 41% of UK exports; the US for 21%. The UK government will probably insist the SPS agreement is good for the British economy. Though animal and plant exports and imports are, in fact, a small part of overall GDP. In reality ""growth is a bit of a red herring here"", says Mr Menon. On the EU side, the French, backed by other fishing nations like the Netherlands and Denmark, have taken a tough stance in these talks - refusing to sign up unless the UK agrees to long-term EU fishing rights in UK waters. The current post-Brexit fishing agreement expires next year. The reset we'll hear about at Monday's summit will also include a ""mobility"" section. Starmer will get his ask, for the EU to recognise UK professional qualifications, to encourage cross-border business. There will also be a reduction in visa restrictions for UK musicians travelling and performing in the EU. In exchange, the EU - and Germany, most passionately -wants a youth mobility scheme,allowing young EU citizens to travel, study, and even work in the UK. The UK has similar schemes with Canada, Australia, South Korea and Japan, amongst others. But this has been tricky to agree. Reducing migration figures is a number one priority for the Labour government. It's a hot-button issue and the UK Home Office will seek to toughen conditions and limit EU numbers. Negotiations are ongoing but, according to EU sources, the scheme already has a name: YES, or Youth Experience Scheme. Some areas of negotiation are more advanced than others. This will be reflected in Monday's announcement. There will also be talk at the summit of plans to tackle illegal migration, cooperate on carbon border taxes, and simplify energy trading between the EU and UK. Reducing EU-UK trade barriers on chemicals and pharmaceutical goods is also a UK ambition, as is getting access to EU databases, like the Schengen Information System, to better track down criminals. But for now, at least, the EU is saying no to that. If it makes an exception for the UK, other non-EU countries will demand the same, it insists. Of course, it's in the interest of both sides to fight cross-border crime. The UK argues the current state of the world calls for more flexible thinking from Brussels. The case for more flexible thinking is also something the UK is calling for when it comes to Monday's defence and security pact with the EU. The EU and UK already work closely together onRussian sanctions and defending Ukraine.And the pact isn't a legally binding document, so how complicated can these talks be, you may ask? The answer is pretty complicated. The UK wants its defence companies to be allowed to bid for contracts under the EU's new re-armament scheme, SAFE (Security Action for Europe). ""The UK has earned the right to access such a deal because of the leadership it's shown over Ukraine,"" says international defence expert Sophia Gaston, a visiting fellow at King's College London. ""Britain is a serious player both in traditional defence capabilities, like producing munitions, and in cutting edge defence innovation, where new growth and energy is. ""If the UK has access to the emerging EU defence programmes, it can contribute to mass and pace. [The war in Ukraine] has shown that both are needed."" But Ms Gaston admits, UK companies getting the go-ahead from Brussels is a ""messy"" process. ""Re-Arm EU"", as Brussels dubs its new drive, is still a work in progress, spurred by rapidly changing geopolitics, including fears the US will withdraw at least some of the crucial security support Europe has relied on since World War Two. This is not yet afully formed EU strategy that the UK can ""pay to play""a part in, as it has done post-Brexit with the EU's research and innovation scheme Horizon, for example. An agreement with the UK in this defence industrial context will be brand new and bespoke. And it's getting political. Signing the security pact on Monday is just a step in the process. France wants to severely restrict non-EU companies bidding for the bloc's defence contracts, including the UK but Canadian and American firms too. If the EU is spending its taxpayers' money on defence, it argues it should be spent with EU companies to help boost EU economies. Paris also says, in this rapidly changing world of shifting alliances and allegiances, the EU should be self-reliant, not dependent on suppliers outside the bloc. Sceptics suspect France,which has a sophisticated defence industry,of wanting to hoover up lucrative EU contracts for itself. But it looks like it is losing the internal EU argument, with the Nordics, the Baltics, Poland, Italy and the Netherlands favouring more openness on defence contracts, and particularly with the EU's biggest economic power, Germany, championing the UK. ""Germany and France have very different attitudes towards the UK,"" says German economist Armin Steinbach from think tank Bruegel. Germany will always put relations with EU heavyweights France and Poland first, says Mr Steinbach. But he believes the UK will be helped in defence and economic negotiations with the EU by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who argues ""a unified Europe is the absolute priority in the current geopolitical setting"". A priority maybe, but it's still a hugely tall order because it's all about compromise. Political leaders will seek to justify increases in defence spending by insisting to voters that it's for their personal security and in the interest of their national economy, with boosts in revenue for domestic defence industries. But achieving a pan-European industrial base - built to be efficient, avoid duplication, and to replace much of the US capacity relied on by the continent today - would mean some European countries winning more defence contracts than others. It would also mean some national businesses shutting down, in favour of better-suited ones elsewhere on the continent. That's a hard sell for political leaders facing their voters. As is another big trade-off: Big increases in defence spending will meangovernments have less money to spend on public services. The challenge for Europe is breathtaking. By comparison, Monday's symbolic EU-UK summit, may seem like a walk in the park. Hull City Council says 80% of the 136 graduates secured jobs within a month. With its powerful beak and venom, this predator is laying waste to crabs and lobsters. For the people who risk life and limb going to sea - the deal is another huge disappointment.

104221,Could swift bricks help bird populations grow?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071kkje5mmo,"In the last 50 years, combined bird populations in the UK and England have declined by 16%. That is almost 73 million fewer breeding birds compared to 1970. A government committee is due to consider an amendment to the Planning and Infrastructure Bill which could make so-called ""swift bricks"" - which provide homes for a variety of cavity nesting birds - compulsory in any new-build developments greater than 5m (16ft) in height. Campaigners think the government will turn its back on nature over fears of being seen as ""too woke"" by those on the right of politics. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the BBC: ""We are unable to comment on the amendment at this stage, as this is still being considered."" In 2020, swifts were added to the UK's red list of birds at most need of conservation. Their populations declined by 66% between 1995 and 2022. Keith Betton has been a birdwatcher for more than 50 years and is a member of Hampshire's Ornithological Society. He said birds were currently struggling to cope with a change in climate and reduced insect populations. ""This is partly because they don't have enough insect food, we use a lot of insecticides these days,"" he said. Mr Betton also urges anyone who has birds nesting on their house to let their local ornithological society know. ""We'll monitor them over the next few years to find out how they're getting on, and if we can, we'll try and help them out as well,"" he said. According to the latestState of Nature Report- changes in the way we manage our land for farming, and climate change were the biggest causes of wildlife decline on our land, rivers and lakes. WhilstDefrasaid bird populations have long provided a good indication of the broad state of wildlife. Among conservation measures approved by wildlife experts are swift bricks which  provide a cavity for swifts and house martins in new-build developments, and cost about £35. As part of her campaign to introduce a law requiring all new-build homes to have at least one swift brick, Hannah Bourne-Taylor walked through London, twice, wearing only pants and paint with swift-themed designs. But after support from Conservative Lord Zac Goldsmith - who first tabled an amendment to a previous planning bill - Mrs Bourne-Taylor fears Labour might turn down the amendment to this bill. Mrs Bourne-Taylor, who live in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, but is originally from Sherborne in Dorset, said she thought it was out of fear of being seen as ""too woke"". ""I really hope the rumours aren't true but I've heard that Labour deem swift bricks, or anything to do with nature 'too woke' in the context of Reform polls shooting upwards,"" she said. ""Nature shouldn't be woke or anti-woke. It's just a crisis for the birds that we can easily solve."" A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government told the BBC: ""We are unable to comment on the amendment at this stage, as this is still being considered."" ""The National Planning Policy Framework already expects developments to provide net gains for biodiversity, including support for priority or threatened species such as swifts, bats and hedgehogs."" The planning and infrastructure bill still has two more sessions at the committee stage before it goes through to the commons. Ms Bourne-Taylor said despite an amendment there were things we could and must do to help. Swifts are not the only birds at risk. According to the British Trust for Ornithology, the numbers of house martins have reduced by 44% over the past three decades. They arrive in the UK in early spring - April and May - to breed, and then migrate south to Africa in the autumn. ""Many places where birds want to nest have literally been taken away,"" said Mr Betton. ""People very often clean away house martin nests off the walls of building. ""We need to do everything we can to help them have an easier time when they get here."" Blashford Lakes in Hampshire is home to an abundance of wildlife across its site, and at Ibsley Water, a new bird tower has been installed. Jack Medley, a reserve officer for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, is one of the people behind the project. ""We identified this area as a really important place. Lots of potential for swifts and house martins."" They use the site already and forage over the lakes for an array of different insects, but Mr Medley said the only thing missing was somewhere for them to breed. ""They don't have to be on towers, people can put boxes on the side of their house. They can put these artificial cups on the side of their house as well,"" he said. Mr Medley said he was worried about bird populations as they are part of the character of the UK and he believes everyone can play a part in making sure they are not lost. ""Whether it's putting up a box or helping out with some volunteering,"" he said. ""What can you do on your patch to make a difference? ""Everyone, if we can all work together, we can make a difference."" You can followBBC Hampshire & Isle of WightonFacebook,X, orInstagram.

282291,Will this woman be the first Briton to walk on the Moon?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyv3z710do,"Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit. It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head. The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet – assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The pool – which is 12m deep (40ft) – contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a ""spacewalk"" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth. ""It's a big day,"" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. ""It's very physically intense – and it's very psychologically intense."" But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water. Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach. ""At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,"" Rosemary says. ""You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories."" So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people. ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015. Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar. She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views. ""It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside – to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia."" Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet. ""The lower part is where you put your solid waste,"" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. ""And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste."" Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to. ""There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system."" Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains. Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity. She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks. Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth. It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit. ""You do a lot of mental preparation – you really think through every single movement,"" Rosemary explains. ""You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again."" Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks. Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts. ""When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,"" he says. ""It is baby steps, but they are moving forward – and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool."" Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V – the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon. ""It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,"" she says. After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test – but then she's thrown a curve ball. In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence. On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition – and tow him back to the airlock. After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is – but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock. ""Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,"" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. ""We're really happy with where she's at – she's doing awesome."" The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling. ""It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,"" she tells us, ""But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day."" Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space. ""It's amazing,"" Rosemary says, ""If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top."" The group was founded by Dr George Capone who said boxing made her feel stronger. A new book How to Kill a Witch brings a dark period of history back to grisly life – and an official tartan is being released to memorialise some of those who were tortured and killed. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, ""space archaeologists"" are scrambling to save what's left. Organisers say a failure to speak out or provide clarity after the Supreme Court gender ruling has led to ""mass confusion"".

480096,Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6yg204pvmo,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017,a government report statedthat systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has beenput at £1.4bn each day– no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on boardcarried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

710302,"Asteroid contains building blocks of life, say scientists",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vd1zjlr5lo,"The chemical building blocks of life have been found in the grainy dust of an asteroid called Bennu, an analysis reveals. Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds. These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA. This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago. Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System. ""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London. ""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?"" The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted. A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023. About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove. ""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks. About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.  The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds. These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA  - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too. Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now. ""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell. This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth. ""The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,"" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum. The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible. But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too. ""Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,"" said Dr King. ""And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?"" It's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer. They have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore. Researchers in the US and Japan are competing to explain the existence of the planets, stars and galaxies. A group of researchers have come to Pipestone Creek in Canada to figure out why thousands of dinosaurs are buried here. A cross-party committee says farmers have lost trust in the government over its policies. Researchers in Japan and US have unlocked the 60-year mystery of what gives cats their orange colour.

705878,Astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,"After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth. Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida. A pod of dolphins circled the craft. After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. ""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference. It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days. It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems. ""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate. Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"". The journey home took 17 hours. The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment. They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families. ""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut. ""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time."" The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space. They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message fora Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home. And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust. ""Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,"" he told the BBC. ""Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment. ""But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing."" In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home. Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: ""I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.""

495879,Beekeeper helping kids get a buzz from nature,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87jpw8p340o,"A beekeeper from Leeds is inspiring a generation of schoolchildren from urban parts of the city to love the winged insects. Kate Turner took up beekeeping during lockdown and began cultivating her own 30,000-strong hive after taking an online course. Ms Turner set up Bee Inspired Eco Education, a community interest company which aims to educate young people about the natural world, last year. Speaking ahead of World Bee Day on Tuesday, Ms Turner said the creatures were ""vital"" for the future of the planet. The species' powers of pollination keep the world's eco-system and food chain thriving, but the United Nations has warned that bees are increasingly under threat from human activities. ""I started learning about bees with a view to then teaching and talking to others about them and inspiring people to love nature,"" Ms Turner said. ""Our young people are our protectors of the future and it's really important that we inspire them to love the world around them and care for it."" With the help of a grant from Climate Action Leeds, Bee Inspired now has a partnership with 10 inner city schools, most of them primaries from deprived neighbourhoods where children may struggle to regularly access green space and nature. Ms Turner, 51, will regularly take a colony to the schools so pupils can learn about the lives of bees. In addition, she runs a hive at the CATCH community centre in Harehills where children from an after-school club get a buzz from observing the insects in their own habitat. ""The kids absolutely love it and their enthusiasm is really infectious,"" she added. ""We do other activities around the importance of planting for bees all year round. We make wildflower seed bombs and talk about the simple things everyone can do, regardless of whether or not they have a garden, to help conserve our bees."" Ms Turner said beekeeping was a ""fascinating hobby"", but warned that due to its cost and complexities it is not one ""you can just jump into without thinking about it"". She added: ""If you want to save bees and help them, the big thing to do is to plant for them. ""Even if you've not got a garden, you can just use a window box and plant flowers in it and that's a brilliant thing to do.""

209679,Plans to extend town's recycling scheme binned,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv7jj4lgyo,"Plans to extend a kerbside recycling scheme have been put on hold due to a lack of facilities to process it. Fareham Borough Council had hoped to boost its collections to include plastic trays, pots and tubs and glass. But Hampshire County Council, which is responsible for waste disposal, first needs to build a new £50m facility. If plastics were collected the authority would incur additional costs to dispose of the material via a third-party or it could choose to get rid of it as remedial waste. The Simpler Recycling scheme is due to come into effect for all households in England from 31 March 2026. The government initiative aims to make recycling more straight forward by standardising waste collection and introducing separate streams for recyclable materials. Hampshire County Council needs to build a new materials recovery facility (MRF). More than £50m is being spent on a new MRF at Chickenhall Lane in Eastleigh and repurposing a site in Portsmouth,according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Despite the legal requirement, Defra has agreed to delay the start date in Hampshire to 2027. The delay means council officers have recommended no change to dry recycling collections is made by Fareham Borough Council until the new MRF is operational. The authority says plans for kerbside food recycling are progressing well. Defra says the council needs to publish a simpler recycling compliance timeline. A new 12-month temporary post will be set up to help residents in Fareham with their recycling. Councillor Sarah Ward said: ""More engagement with residents means there are better recycling outcomes.""

702370,Titanic scan reveals ground-breaking details of ship's final hours,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o,"A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours. The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on. And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise. ""Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,"" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst. The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection. The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots. More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the ""digital twin"",which was revealedexclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023. Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic. The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage. But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half. The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship. ""It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,"" said Parks Stephenson. ""And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here."" The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision. Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two. Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves. The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water. Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system. This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on. All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson. ""They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,"" he told the BBC. ""They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern."" A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking. It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg. ""We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,"" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research. The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull. Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments. ""The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,"" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle. ""But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks."" Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment. The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible. Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor. The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica. ""She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,"" said Parks Stephenson. ""Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.""

579254,Climate experts criticise handling of Tata changes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79ezrvd9neo,"The UK's climate change advisors have criticised the handling of a switch to greener steelmaking at the country's largest plant in Port Talbot, which resulted in huge job losses. Government ministers should have been better at planning ahead and making sure other green jobs were available locally, the experts said. The independentClimate Change Committee(CCC) has set out its latest advice on how Walesreaches net zero- with a push for more electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting. The Welsh and UK governments said they had been working together to develop ""a strong vision"" for the region's future and deliver ""our clean energy superpower mission"". More than 2,000 jobs were lost at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks following the closure of its blast furnaces in 2024. The move broughtan end to traditional steelmaking at the site, as the company grappled with losses of over £1m a day. It was given a £500m grant by the UK government and is now investing £1.25bn to build a new electric arc furnace by 2027. This will recycle scrap metal into new steel products, but requires far fewer workers on site. The changes will havea dramatic impact on direct emissions of planet-warming gasesfrom Wales. The blast furnaces were constantly fed with coal, and their closure will have more than halved Wales' industrial emissions since 2022, according to the CCC. But environmentalists have warned the situation at Port Talbot could damage public support for climate action if it is seen to mean job losses and the demise of heavy industry. In its report, the CCC said there were ""important lessons to learn"", and that governments in both Westminster and Cardiff Bay should have been better prepared. ""The challenges facing the UK steel sector have been clear for many years and, given the significance of this site to the local economy, a more proactive and decisive transition plan should have been developed,"" they argued. The UK government should have taken steps to make industrial electricity prices more competitive, and convened ""early and collaborative"" negotiations between plant owners, workers and the community, the report said. The Welsh government could have ensured ""the right training and re-skilling programmes were in place well before closure"", it added, and developed a local industrial strategy to support alternative employment in areas like heating services and floating offshore wind. The committee said Port Talbot's experience should now be used ""to guide future efforts to decarbonise other strategically and locally-significant emissions-intensive industries,"" citing Pembroke's oil refineries as an example. Former steelworker Shaun Spencer, who now works for a firm training electrical engineers, said he agreed with the committee's comments ""100%"". He warned the feeling of ""resentment and bitterness"" was ""very strong"" among his former colleagues. He added the approach had been detrimental to ""everybody's views of net zero"" and to support for the way the UK and Welsh governments deal with things, ""especially in this area"". Emma Pinchbeck, the CCC's chief executive, told BBC news what had happened at Port Talbot was ""foreseeable and preventable"", and had ""not been the best case study"" for what a green transition should look like. Like the UK, Wales has set a legally binding net zero target, which means that by 2050 it should no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The CCC provides independent advice on how much can be emitted over five-year periods, known as ""carbon budgets"", and how each UK nation might achieve this. Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero, with the latest advice covering the period between 2031-35. The report recommends a 73% reduction in average annual emissions over this period compared to how much Wales pumped into the atmosphere in 1990. Emissions have decreased by 37% so far and the country met its first carbon budget between 2016-2020 mainly through changes to electricity generation - such as the closure of the last remaining coal-fired power station at Aberthaw in Vale of Glamorgan. Future cuts will rely more on all of us making choices about how we live. The CCC has made 16 ""priority"" recommendations for immediate action. These include supporting people to better insulate their homes and install low-carbon heating systems, drive electric vehicles or opt for public transport. By 2033 - in just eight years' time - a third of cars and vans on Welsh roads should be electric, the committee said, and nearly a quarter of existing homes need a heat pump or similar technology. The committee also said the Welsh government will need to support farmers and rural communities to ""diversify their income"" away from livestock farming and towards woodland creation and peatland restoration. In 2022, agriculture was the third-highest emitting sector in Wales, accounting for 16% of Wales' emissions. Cattle and sheep numbers should fall by 19% by 2033 due to changes in agricultural policy but also a shift in diets with less meat and dairy consumed UK-wide, the report has predicted. The proportion of woodland cover across Wales will rise from 15% to 17% in 2033 and 26% by 2050, according to the committee's projections. Farming union NFU Cymru said the Welsh government needed to ""reflect and consider"" whether that advice fit ""with the circumstances we have in Wales"". ""Many thousands of people rely on agriculture and livestock production,"" said the union's president Aled Jones. The Welsh government thanked the CCC for the report which it said it would now ""review and use to set Carbon Budget 4 in regulation before the end of the year"". A spokesman said it had been working with the UK government, the local authority and key stakeholders as part of the Tata Steel UK transition board to support affected individuals and businesses and develop a ""strong vision for the future of the region"". It hoped do this by ""making the most of"" opportunities from new infrastructure and investment in areas such as renewable energy, he added. The UK government said it had committed £2.5bn ""to rebuild the steel industry for decades to come as it decarbonises"". ""Decarbonisation should not mean deindustrialisation and we will ensure a bright and sustainable future for UK steelmaking,"" a spokesman added. ""We will work with the Welsh government as we deliver our clean energy superpower mission and accelerate to net zero, growing our economy and making working people better off.""

921985,Sutton Hoo bucket believed to be cremation vessel,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly31wdl4x2o,"A 6th Century Byzantine bucket that has been pieced back together is believed to have been a cremation vessel, according to archaeologists. Fragments of the bucket were first discovered at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, in 1986 with more found in 2012 andlast year. Archaeologists have revealed that cremated human and animal bones were found within the base of the bucket, with the human remains believed to belong to an ""important person"" in the community. Angus Wainwright, National Trust archaeologist, said he hoped further analysis would ""uncover more information about this very special burial"". The TV show Time Team found pieces of the bucket last year, as part of atwo-year research projectwith FAS Heritage and the National Trust exploring the earlier history of the site. The copper alloy bucket, decorated with a hunting scene, is thought to have been made several decades before the famousSutton Hoo shipand its treasures were buried at the site. The human bones found in last year's dig included part of an ankle bone and fragments of skull. While the sex could not be determined, it is hoped that ancient DNA from the owner might have survived on an unburnt comb that was discovered. Animal bones that were found belonged to a species larger than a pig. Horses were often included on early Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres as a sign of status. The bucket base and comb will now be carefully conserved to allow further study and reconstruction. ""We knew that this bucket would have been a rare and prized possession back in Anglo-Saxon times, but it's always been a mystery why it was buried,"" Mr Wainwright said. ""Now we know it was used to contain the remains of an important person in the Sutton Hoo community. ""I'm hopeful that further analysis will uncover more information about this very special burial."" Helen Geake, Time Team's Anglo-Saxon expert, said the ""puzzle"" of the bucket had ""finally"" been solved. ""It's a remarkable mixture - a vessel from the southern, classical world containing the remains of a very northern, very Germanic cremation,"" she said. ""It epitomises the strangeness of Sutton Hoo - it has ship burials, horse burials, mound burials and now bath-bucket burials. ""Who knows what else it might still hold?""

Writer Sophie Pierce and artist Alex Murdin have lived together on the moor for 25 years and said they wanted to find a way to help more people experience it for themselves. The event, during the last bank holiday weekend in May, will take place at the Ashburton Arts Centre, with walks across Dartmoor. Ms Pierce said:  ""Topics range from archaeology, to right to roam and how artists have perceived Dartmoor. ""It has so many layers of interest; history, folklore and culture. ""I think, perhaps, those of us who live locally are probably maybe a little bit guilty of not really appreciating it... We really want to spread the joy of this amazing place."" The seeds of this festival were planted during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Alex started drawing the tors he had known most of his life but could not visit during lockdown. The pictures became the inspiration for a guide book about Dartmoor's granite tors called Rock Idols, written with his wife Sophie. When the couple started walking to 28 of them to research the book, they rediscovered all sorts of facts and stories about landscape that they wanted to share with other people, and so the Dartmoor Tors Festival was born. Alex said: ""During lockdown, I was focused on the place I lived... but I couldn't get out on the moor... so I started drawing the tors and got a better understanding of what they meant to me and the place I live in."" The festival aims to get more people out on Dartmoor by guiding them on themed walks. Archaeologist Alan Endacott is running a walk from Belstone called Dartmoor's Newest Prehistory. It was an opportunity for members of the public to see the stone circles that he identified for the first time on a dig last year, he said. The money from the ticket sales from his walk would go towards paying for the carbon dating of the charcoal that he discovered, helping further his research, he said. At there other end of the spectrum, storytellers and performers Sara Hurley and Lisa Schneidau will be running a walk near Hound Tor. Their event, Myths of the Moor, plans to bring to life the route guided by Gillian Healey with stories such as Kitty Jay's grave. Lisa said: ""Before anything was written down, before anything was recorded, everyone was telling stories. ""That was the way to pass down wisdom or provide entertainment."" The Beltane Boarder Morris and musician Seth Lakeman are also among the acts that will be performing from the 23-25 May. Surreal Succulents' boss Daniel Michael says he is ""over the moon"" to win the award again. Officers are called to the A38 at Eggbuckland after reports of an injured deer on the central reservation. Devon and Cornwall Police say the eight people that were found are receiving specialist support. Officers were called to Kings Road on Tuesday after a collision between a car and a motorbike.

1047486,Decades-long mystery of ginger cats revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywdjjgvqqo,"Garfield, Puss in Boots,  Aristocats' Toulouse – cultural icons maybe, ginger most certainly. And now scientists across two continents have uncovered the DNA mystery that has given our furry friends, particularly males, their notable colour. They discovered that ginger cats are missing a section of their genetic code, which means the cells responsible for their skin, eye and fur tone produce lighter colours. The breakthrough has brought delight to the scientists but also the thousands of cat lovers that originally crowdfunded the research. The scientists hope solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange coloured cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions. It has been known for decades that it is genetics that gives orange tabby cats their distinctive colouring, but exactly where in the genetic code has evaded scientists till now. Two teams of scientists at Kyushu University in Japan and Stanford University in the US have now revealed the mystery in simultaneous paperspublished on Thursday. What the teams found was that in the cells responsible for giving a cat its skin, hair follicles and eyes their colour - melanocytes - one gene, ARHGAP36, was much more active. Genes are made up of pieces of DNA which give instructions to a cat's cells, like other living creatures, on how to function. By comparing the DNA from dozens of cats with and without orange fur they found that those with ginger colouring had a section of DNA code missing within this ARHGAP36 gene. Without this DNA the activity of the ARHGAP36 is not suppressed i.e. it is more active. The scientists believe that the gene instructs those melanocytes to produce lighter pigment.  For decades scientists have observed that cats with completely ginger colouring are far more likely to be male. This tallies with the fact that the gene is carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are larger sections of DNA, and male cats like other mammals have an X and a Y chromosome, which carry different number of genes. As it is a gene only on the X chromosome, in this case controlling the pigment production, then one missing piece of DNA is enough to turn a cat fully ginger. In comparison female cats have two X chromosomes so the DNA needs to be missing in both chromosomes to increase lighter pigment production to the same extent - it means a mixed colouring is more likely. ""These ginger and black patches form because, early in development, one X chromosome in each cell is randomly switched off,"" explains Prof Hiroyuki Sasaki, geneticist at Kyushu University. ""As cells divide, this creates areas with different active coat colour genes, resulting in distinct patches."" Although couched in science, the study originally started off as a passion project for Professor Sasaki. He had retired from his university post, but as a cat lover said he wanted to continue working to uncover the orange cat gene in the hope it could ""contribute to the overcoming of cat diseases"". He and his team raised 10.6m yen (£55,109) via crowdfunding for the research from thousands of fellow cat lovers across Japan and the world. One contributor wrote: ""We are siblings in the first and third grades of elementary school. We donated with our pocket money. Use it for research on calico cats."" The ARHGAP36 gene is also active in many other areas of the body including the brain and hormonal glands, and is considered important for development. The researchers think it is possible that the DNA mutation in the gene could cause other changes in these parts of the body linked to health conditions or temperament. The ARHGAP36 gene is found in humans and has been linked to skin cancer and hair loss. ""Many cat owners swear by the idea that different coat colours and patterns are linked with different personalities,"" said Prof Sasaki. ""There's no scientific evidence for this yet, but it's an intriguing idea and one I'd love to explore further."" Hartsholme Academy in Lincoln is exploring ways to remove the animals due to child safety concerns. Little William evades capture for days in a protracted community effort to save him. It is the second to be born there since October and is vital for the breed's future, keepers say. Animal rescuers say there is an increase in the number of cats not being neutered and them dumped.

779949,Exceptionally low river levels raise fears over water supplies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkn7rjv7zo#comments,"Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses. The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century. Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales. The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions. The next 2-3 weeks will be ""crucial"" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group. That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way. The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt. Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year. ""We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,"" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk. He had to start irrigating his fields in March. ""We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,"" he said. He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported. The dry and sunny weather this year has led to alarger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year. The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s. Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation. That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather. However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on. But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does ""potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,"" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues. At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be. There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week. Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions. Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies. By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies. Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas. If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes. In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976. Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought. Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed. And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms. Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than £1m. It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions. But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult. A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs. He added: ""Over £104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer. That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.

582176,Endangered axolotl release raises hopes for rare amphibian,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xr2jzelyo,"One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered. In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City. The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they ""survived and foraged successfully at both sites"" - even gaining weight. Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an ""amazing result"". The findings are publishedin the journal PLoS Oneand they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat. The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians. But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild. ""If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,"" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico. It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander. ""If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,"" Dr Zambrano continued, ""I feel that we have hope for humanity."" To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland ""refuges"" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water, The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an ""artificial wetland"". Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device. ""The amazing news is that they all survived,"" Dr Ramos told BBC News. ""And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting."" The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. ""We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,"" Dr Ramos explained. Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. ""Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,"" said Dr Ramos. ""And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. ""You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out."" Kate Turner works with schools from inner city Leeds to educate young people about the insects.

88361,"Coastlines in danger even if climate target met, scientists warn",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj93e40znl3o,"The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several metres or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned. Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered ""safe"" for coastal populations. They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past. But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks. The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities. But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say. ""Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,"" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University. The2015 Paris climate agreementsaw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises ""well below"" 2C - and ideally 1.5C. That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is ""safe"", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years. The authors of the new paper, published in the journalCommunications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case. First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting – with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago. And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher. Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year. ""Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,"" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable. ""We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,"" added Prof Stokes. Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good. ""Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,"" said Prof Stokes. The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond ""tipping points"" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit. ""The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,"" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication. ""This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,"" he added. An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines. Defining a ""safe"" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others. But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say. ""If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],"" argued Prof Bamber. However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say. ""The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,"" said Prof Stokes. ""Every fraction of a degree really matters for ice sheets.""

778415,Energy boss warns over future of gas storage facility,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mrwdzvrmzo,"The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC. Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be ""shut down"" without government help over energy pricing. Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose £100m this year, and it wants to invest £2bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen. The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals. The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas. It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in ""constructive discussions"" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed. The company is seeking a ""cap and floor"" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high. ""What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock £2bn of investment,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC. ""It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore."" Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned ""and we'll lose this resilience"". He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six. ""So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days."" A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, ""we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers"". Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not ""materially"" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels. He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a ""huge economic opportunity"". However he added that ""the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments"". ""Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price."" He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was ""very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target"". ""It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy."" The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills."" Last year, Mr O'Shea told the BBC that the £4.5m pay he received the previous yearwas ""impossible to justify"". And earlier this month, nearly 40% of Centrica's shareholders voted against the company's latest pay plans. When asked about this by Laura Kuenssberg, Mr O'Shea said: ""I don't set my own pay. ""I think it's really difficult,"" he said. ""I am unbelievably fortunate. I have a job where the market rate is is more than ever thought I would have done."" Experts say the UK has enough gas after Centrica said storage levels were ""concerningly low"". Albert Taylor says his fight for a British Gas refund was like ""banging my head against a brick wall"". Yeovil Athletic Club is ""futureproofed"" with the latest in technology in a bid to reduce running costs. The firm told a man it was sending his details to a debt collector over an incorrect £2,500 bill. Centrica says it is installing four ultra-efficient hydrogen-ready engines at its site in Brigg.

350413,Appeal hearing into major solar farm set to begin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9y5vnq15lo,"A public inquiry is set to get under way following the rejection of plans for a major solar farm in Northamptonshire. The proposed facility would cover 145 acres (59 hectares) alongside the A14 near Thrapston. North Northamptonshire Council turned down the plans in October 2024, against the advice of its planning officers. Following an appeal from the developer, the Planning Inspectorate will now hold a public inquiry over two days, starting on Tuesday. The proposed site of Wood Lodge Solar Farm would span 145 acres (59 hectares) near the A14 at Thrapston. The applicant said the development was designed to generate enough power for up to 15,000 homes. Wood Lodge Solar Project Limited also claims it will deliver green energy that saves 21,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions compared to fossil fuels. It has said the proposed site is the ""lowest grade land within reach of the grid connection point"" and the project ""represents a forward-thinking solution that supports the country's transition to renewable energy"". Campaign group Staunch is opposed to the plans and is fighting the appeal as aRule 6 party, which is when a group other than the appellant and local authority has permission to take an active part and provide evidence. Kevin Shapland, group chair, said: ""In principle, Staunch are in favour of renewable energy and recognise its importance. ""However, solar farm developments should not be taking place on good agricultural land which is so vital in securing the future needs of our country."" Planning officers had advised the council to approve the project, arguing the renewable energy benefits outweighed potential harms. However, the council's planning committeevoted against the proposalin October after hearing from residents and campaigners who claimed the solar farm would dominate the countryside and consume valuable farmland. In February, North Northamptonshire Council said it would not be defending its decision at the inquiry. Jason Smithers, then council leader, said at the time: ""The planning inspector will hear all views, evidence and facts before making a decision. ""The council will support and co-operate fully with the Planning Inspectorate, including working on a statement of common ground which will establish those matters which are agreed with the main parties, and which will assist the planning inspector in their decision."" The hearing is due to begin on Tuesday at the council chamber of North Northamptonshire Council in Thrapston. It is expected to last two days and will hear from the appellant and interested parties. The planning inspector's verdict will be released on an unspecified date following the hearing. Follow Northamptonshire news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX.

519763,Nasa needs saving from itself – but is this billionaire right for that job?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93797z2dpo,"Listen to Pallab read this article Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity. He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 – a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (£160m) for – and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date – most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy. ""We want it to be 600,000,"" he told reporters. Later, he added: ""I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species… I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft."" Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (£1.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space. Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule andperforming the first commercial spacewalk. During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock. The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic – it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology. And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still – being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa. The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do – especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX ownerElon Musk to a government roleto cut $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) off the Federal budget. The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now. In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs. Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values. And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space. They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel. On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. ""This second space age has only just begun,"" he wrote. ""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy – one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space… At Nasa, we will… usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation."" Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, butTrump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan. But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets. That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank. ""You have a government looking to slash,"" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. ""If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget… ""This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table."" One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch. By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch – and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (£8m) as he develops his system. Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (£54.5m). Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further. Starshipand New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But ""that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs"", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University. ""SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,"" he continues. ""They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs. ""A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way. ""There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future."" The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: ""Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs. ""Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (£20bn) for key activities"". Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration – some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (£800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 – but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of ""the telescope that ate astronomy"". (Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.) It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s. Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US. But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. ""Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue."" The current model is to give so-called ""cost-plus"" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit. The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that tookApollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns. Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things. ""We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things."" Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget. Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo. The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job. SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years – only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronautsButch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station. The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule. ""Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,"" says Prof Logsdon. ""So, shaking up the system is very positive."" Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS ""outrageously expensive"" and said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"". But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (£20bn) annual budget. ""Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,"" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress. Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt. ""The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,"" argues Prof Logsdon. ""There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House."" Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy – Musk – seated nearby. Others fear cuts inNasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme. There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (£16bn) in contracts from government since 2008. But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players. And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March. But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon. ""Isaacman is his own man,"" he adds. ""He is not a disciple of Elon Musk."" Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue – Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion. But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception. ""Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,"" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. ""That is frustrating for all of us."" Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: ""Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service. ""The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things – and there are so many hard things"".

442084,Mystery of medieval cemetery near airport runway deepens,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241e3jr7qlo,"A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying. The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century,was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts. Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury. Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care. ""Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,"" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project. About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated. So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female. ""I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,"" said Dr Seaman. ""It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery."" The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features. ""The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,"" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University. ""It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery."" Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were. Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead. ""Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,"" said Dr Seaman. ""It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels."" The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west. The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal. They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her. Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.  Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis. The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too. Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related. The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth. Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death. ""They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,"" said Dr Faillace. ""And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population. ""But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries."" The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery. Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up. ""We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,"" he said. ""We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.""

712042,Exceptionally low river levels raise fears over water supplies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmkn7rjv7zo,"Many of the UK's rivers have hit exceptionally low levels and that could worsen in the next three months, according to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), raising questions over supplies to households, farmers and businesses. The warning comes after the driest spring in England since 1961, with northern regions experiencing the driest start to the year in nearly a century. Almost all of the UK is expected to have below normal or low river levels in May, apart from the south-west of England and southern Wales. The Environment Agency has said that the UK is at medium risk of drought and warned households of the risk of water restrictions. The next 2-3 weeks will be ""crucial"" in determining whether the country goes into drought, says Mark Owen, head of fisheries for the Angling Trust and a member of the National Drought Group. That is the committee, led by the government, that declares if and when a drought is officially under way. The country is not now in drought, but the impacts of the exceptionally dry weather are already being felt. Some farmers are being forced to water their crops instead of relying on rainfall, which is something that normally happens later in the year. ""We are having a drought now from an agricultural point of view,"" arable farmer Nick Deane told BBC News from his farm in Norfolk. He had to start irrigating his fields in March. ""We have to ration our water and decide which areas we are going to put that water on in order to keep the crops growing,"" he said. He warned that an extremely long drought would mean farmers struggle to produce food and more produce would need to be imported. The dry and sunny weather this year has led to alarger area of the UK burned by wildfires this year compared with any other entire year. The last drought was in June-August 2022, which was the joint hottest summer (with 2018) and fifth driest since the 1890s. Five companies introduced hosepipe bans, affecting 19 million people, and waterways had restricted navigation. That drought was preceded by six months of very dry weather. However, the wet summer in 2024 and moderately-wet winter means water supplies are in a better place now and water companies have larger reserves to rely on. But dry weather earlier in the year has risks. It does ""potentially pose a greater risk to water resources later on in the year, particularly if the dry weather continues,"" says Stephen Turner, hydrologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Last week, Richard Thompson, chair of the National Drought Group, warned that water companies may need to bring in water restrictions to protect supplies if the dry weather continues. At the moment the key questions are when will it next rain and when it does, how much will there be. There are some signs that some rain is on the horizon, with unsettled weather from the west at the end of next week. Drinking water comes from different places depending on the geography and geology of regions. Roughly speaking, the south of England takes a long time to get into drought but a long time to leave. That's because a lot of rainfall is stored in rocks underground and takes a long time to reach rivers and water supplies. By contrast, the north of England quickly enters drought and quickly gets out because reservoirs are more heavily used for water supplies. Water Companies introduce hosepipe bans when water supplies reach a certain low in their areas. If drought conditions become severe, the government can restrict irrigation of farms, reduce boats' movement on waterways, and limit water available to non-essential businesses like car washes. In an extreme scenario, it could ration the amount of water available to homes and businesses but that has not happened since 1976. Water industry bosses and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) are calling on the government to do more to ensure the driest parts of the UK have secure water supplies in the face of any future drought. Water UK, which represents the water industry, is calling for a new national water grid of pipes, canals and reservoirs to be set up in England to move water from the wettest regions to where it is most needed. And farmers say they need more government funding and less planning red tape to build their own reservoirs to supply their farms. Mr Deane came together with five other farmers, including fruit growers, to build their own reservoir. It took four years and cost more than £1m. It has proved vital, they say, with 15% of the stored water already used this year in the dry conditions. But the group said obtaining planning permission was costly and difficult. A government spokesman said it was working with the agricultural sector to improve its water supply resilience and establish more groups of farmers who could work together to develop their own reservoirs. He added: ""Over £104bn of private sector investment has been secured to fund essential infrastructure, including nine new reservoirs, to help secure our future water supply for farmers."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer. That could exacerbate other forms of drought like hydrological or agricultural drought, according to the Met Office.

761074,National Park will not object to gas drill plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7gvjz45lvo,"Planners at the North York Moors National Park Authority have said they will not object to proposals to drill for gas on nearby land. Europa Oil and Gas Ltd has submitted a planning application for the temporary plant near Burniston, north of Scarborough. The ""proppant squeeze"" project, which would include a 30m (98ft) drilling rig, hasprompted demonstrations from local residents. However, members of the authority said the site's impact on the national park would be ""limited"" because it was 800m away. A report added that a ""degree of harm"" caused by the direct visibility of the development had been considered. However, it said: ""Subject to clarification of certain matters and subject to imposition of appropriate controls, it is however concluded that this relatively short-term development would not lead to significant harm to the delivery of national park statutory purposes, or to national park special qualities."" The committee did ask for clarification on issues including the time that the test rig would be in place, and the proposed route of HGVs visiting the site. According to the planning application, the site potentially has significant gas resource. If the tests were successful, a new application would be submitted for a more permanent drill site, it said. The meeting heard the 30m (98ft) drilling rig would be part of a ""proppant squeeze"" test project, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Europa Oil and Gashas previously saidthat a ""slurry"" would be injected into the well to fracture surrounding rocks, allowing more gas to be recovered. The technique, which has been described as ""small-scale fracking"", has been accused by some of being a loophole in the UK's moratorium on the controversial fossil fuel extraction process. However, proppant squeeze procedures have been regularly used in the UK for a number of years and industry experts consider the technique low-volume, unlike the process formally termed 'hydraulic fracturing'.

201361,Movement controls brought in over bluetongue virus,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787jyg981no,"Movement restrictions have been placed on cattle, sheep and some other livestock in Lancashire following the discovery of bluetongue virus in the county. Bluetongue virus, which is mainly spread by midge bites, does not affect humans or risk food safety. In rare instances, however, dogs and other carnivores can contract it if they consume infected substances such as aborted material and afterbirth. Restrictions were introduced on Sunday. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has not yet responded to a request from the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) for further details. Lancashire has joined several other parts of England already covered by a Defra-designated ""restricted zone"" designed to stem the spread of the disease. Within restricted zones, there are strict controls on the movement of animals classed as ruminants. These include sheep, cattle, goats and deer as well as camelids such as llamas and alpacas. Bluetongue is classed as a ""notifiable"" disease, meaning it is an offence not to report it to the authorities. Livestock owners have been told to keep a close watch for bluetongue and to report any suspicions to Defra. Under the newly introduced rules, ruminating animals and camelids can only be moved out of a restricted zone if permitted to do so by a vet. No livestock can be moved within a control zone if there are clinical signs of bluetongue. Dairy cattle may be moved from the restricted zone to their usual milking parlour and returned directly to their place of origin – provided they go by foot to and from what is the regular place of milking used for the relevant herd. Signs of bluetongue in sheep include ulcers or sores in the mouth and nose, discharge from the eyes or nose and drooling from mouth, and the swelling of the lips, tongue, head and neck, as well as the coronary band (where the skin of the leg meets the horn of the foot). Other symptoms include red skin as a result of blood collecting beneath the surface, fever, lameness, breathing problems, abortion, foetal deformities and stillbirths. The disease can be fatal. Lambs can become infected with bluetongue virus before birth if the dam is infected while pregnant. Signs of infection include lambs born small, weak, deformed or blind. They can die within a few days of birth, and some can be stillborn. In cattle, signs of bluetongue include lethargy, crusty erosions around the nostrils and muzzle, and redness of the mouth, eyes and, nose;. Additionally, there can be reddening of the skin above the hoof, nasal discharge, reddening and erosions on the teats, fever, milk drop, and a loss of appetite. Cows may abort their calves and there can be foetal deformities and stillbirths. Adult cattle may be infectious for several weeks while showing little or no sign of disease. They are often the preferred host for the biting midges that carry and transmit bluetongue virus. Like lambs, calves can become infected with bluetongue virus before birth if the mother is infected while pregnant. Signs of infection include calves born small, weak, deformed or blind. Some infected calves die within a few days of birth, while others are stillborn. Listen to the best ofBBC Radio Lancashire on Soundsand follow BBC Lancashire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

719522,Bat hurdle for man seeking to demolish 'flood' home,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz633lyw554o,"A man is seeking permission to demolish his own cottage in Wellington, near Hereford, because repeated flooding has made it a liability. However, a Herefordshire Council ecology officer has opposed the bid to take down the former stable near the village's brook. In his application, homeowner Nick Jones said he had spent 10 years maintaining and repairing his home, including installing flood defences, but Vinery Cottage in Mill Lane was uninsurable, uninhabitable and could not be rented. Ecology officer James Bisset said the building offered potential features for bat roosting which ""has previously been recorded in the locality"". Papers said Mr Jones was not able to insure the building or contents, and maintenance and repair costs after successive floods exceeded any realistic rental value. He said: ""I spent 10 years converting it at considerable cost. Then we had the storm damage, which has cost me about £40,000 each time to repair.""

71357,Area burned by UK wildfires in 2025 already at annual record,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gm3jwljo,"The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests. More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012. That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019. The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers. Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly. The switch back towetter conditions over the past couple of weekshas largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels. The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km). More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year. Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly. ""We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,"" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office. ""This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start."" A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires. ""The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,"" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London. ""Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable."" The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record. The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year. InGalloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total. A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km. Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April. These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated. Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health. Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover. Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again. ""My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,"" said Prof Rein, when ""there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic"". ""You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses."" The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season. But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year. Astudy led by the Met Officefound that the extreme ""fire weather"" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change. Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk. ""One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,"" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh. ""We need to be prepared for this to become more common.""

683349,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno#comments,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

384440,The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30mjedjzgpo,"Listen to Esme read this article Donald Trump's return to the White House is a ""major blow to global climate action"". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November. Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets. Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a ""green new scam"". And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada – both nations rich in critical minerals. Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology. So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector? Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla – the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets). Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium. She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors. Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: ""Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve."" He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow. The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: ""The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China."" Failure to do so, it warned, could cause ""defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies"". China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers. ""China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,"" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. ""You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country."" Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply – like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray. China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock). ""China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,"" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten. What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,"" he says. ""It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money."" As he puts it, it is a ""happy coincidence"" that this could end up supporting green technology. The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector. In the early days, the green transition was ""framed as a burden"" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward. The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels. By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (£382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor. And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer. But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening. ""The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,"" explains Ms Gray. ""Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US."" There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a ""Critical Minerals Executive Order"", which could funnel further investment into this objective. The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants. Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. ""If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years."" As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed ""big, beautiful bill"" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month. Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment. MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the ""battery belt"" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive. He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years. If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation. Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. ""In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA."" He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA – although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. ""If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess."" But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. ""When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement."" For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.

821639,Royals and Beckham attend Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q0w2v83wzo,"The Chelsea Flower show opened its gates to royalty and celebrities on Monday, with dogs, unusually, taking the spotlight. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were among the first to tour the gardens on display, being joined by famous figures like football icon David Beckham and actress Cate Blanchett. This year's event favours rewilding and sustainability, with mossy paving, native planting and gravel paths. Designers leaned into natural landscapes shaped by climate change and a growing desire to reconnect with nature. But it was not just the planting that got people talking. The RHS and BBC Radio 2 Dog Garden, created by Monty Don, gave four-legged visitors rare top billing. Created with canine comfort in mind, it features dog-friendly lawns, water for wallowing and shade-providing trees. Names of royal and broadcaster-owned dogs are etched into brick paths – including the late Beth, the Queen's Jack Russell, her new puppy Moley and the King's dog Snuff. Don, not usually a fan of show gardens, said the chance to celebrate the dog-owner bond had won him over. The garden will not be judged and will not stay. After Chelsea, it will find a permanent home at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. Along with Beckham and Blanchett, Dame Joanna Lumley and actor David Tennant were among those getting a preview of the world-famous event, along with BBC presenter Zoe Ball. The garden inspired by eight-year-old Liam won a RHS Silver Gilt medal at this year's Chelsea Flower Show. Stanislav Carpiuc, 26, has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, police say. A boy, 17, and girl, 16, plead guilty to killing the animals found in a field on 3 May. A two-year-old boy has died after falling from height in south-east London, the Met Police said.

66049,Wild chimpanzees filmed using forest 'first aid',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj7ln85vxwo,"Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants - in multiple ways - to treat open wounds and other injuries. University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate. The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use ""forest first aid"". Researchers say the study, which is published in the journalFrontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild. Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was ""a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene"". ""Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,"" she explained. ""The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury."" The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body. They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, ""because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy"". Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala. This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s – local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed. There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs. There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating. This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties. Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound. Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines. ""The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,"" Dr Freymann told BBC News. ""If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick."" ""But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings.""

352345,Green hydrogen facility proposed for Inverness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx277q04l09o,"Highland Council is asking people in Inverness for their views on plans to develop a green hydrogen production facility on a former waste landfill site. Aconsultationis started on a proposal to change the use of an area owned by the local authority in East Longman. Storegga Hydrogen (Cromarty) Limited wants to build and operate a facility capable of producing about 6,400 tonnes of electrolytic hydrogen every year. Residents have until 15 July to respond. Hydrogen atoms are found in substances like water, plants and fossil fuels, and they can be turned into fuel for cars, heat for homes and power for industry. The fuel releases water when it is consumed, rather than carbon emissions. Renewable energy is used in the process to make green hydrogen. Storegga Hydrogen (Cromarty) Limited claims the Inverness facility could reduce carbon emissions and support the decarbonisation of the Longman Industrial Estate. The company is seeking to lease an area of land owned by Highland Council. Transport Scotland says the plans will make the busy Raigmore Interchange safer for all road users. The Care Inspectorate has served the site in Inverness with an improvement notice. A public inquiry will hear opposing arguments after the refusal of plans for the site near the A14. A group seeking the return of consultant-led services in Wick says it gives a ""huge amount of support"". A 675-acre (273-hectare) plot of land is earmarked for the White Elm project in mid-Suffolk.

269841,Fire-hit dunes 'could take years to recover',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8ddqyvrl2o,"Sand dunes badly damaged in a fire could take years to recover, experts have said. Naomi Kay, manager of Solway Coast National Landscape, said the damage caused to an area of Silloth Dunes at the weekend - roughly the size of two football pitches - was ""horrifying"" and had destroyed wildlife habitats. Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said it was still investigating the cause of the blaze but warned people of the risk of barbecues and camping stoves in the countryside. Ms Kay said the area was ""blackened and horrible to look at"" and, while it was hoped new growth would be seen in the area within a year, it could take up to 20 years to recover completely. ""We are in the season where everything is growing, birds are nesting and plants are growing,"" she said. ""The area at the moment is blackened and horrible but we should see growth, perhaps nettles dominating, within a year - nothing special. ""But it will take five to 10 years for vegetation to come back and even longer for the food chain species to come back. ""We could be looking at 10 or 20 years."" The fire service urged people who spot wildfires to ring 999 immediately.  Follow BBC Cumbria onX,Facebook,NextdoorandInstagram.

416965,Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6denxzweeo,"Listen to Justin read this article Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers — a routine they have gone through many a time before. It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads – for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations. They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London. However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously. In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, ""hanging up the hi-viz"" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience. The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate. Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a ""joyful celebration"". ""We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,"" she says. The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost £20m. But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that? JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable – they had to wait around to get arrested. For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity. The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the ""eco-loons"", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call. The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made ""intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance"" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing ""serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity"" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time. The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including ""locking on"" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure. At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a ""lawful excuse"" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the ""beliefs and motivation"" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it. ""We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,"" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon. David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously ""favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people."" The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy. Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have ""had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe"". In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability – they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more. Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables. I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore. ""It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,"" the spokesperson told me. ""Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground."" I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works. This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall. The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions. He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people. ""There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,"" he says. Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance – implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO – against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies. The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they ""arrest"" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for. The group claims to have ""arrested"" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, ""disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,"" she says. These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers. Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed. But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions. ""It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,"" he tells me. ""Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority."" Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public. Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way. But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group. According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy. There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO. Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning. ""Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,"" says Read, ""but that's not the same thing as getting real change."" They generated a lot of headlines: ""[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause."" John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change. But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. ""I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,"" he says. His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns. XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. ""If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,"" he says. He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities. ""The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,"" explains Read. Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes ""empowering"" voters should be the focus. ""We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk […] truth to power."" But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. ""If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest […] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest."" He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO. Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage ""they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences."" But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. ""We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,"" says Packham. It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. ""The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,"" she says. ""Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue."" However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.

758240,Castle acquires largest Anglo-Saxon gold coin hoard,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgn9egd7eo,"A museum is to become the new home to what is believed to be the largest collection of 7th Century gold coins found in Britain. Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery in Norfolk has acquired the hoard which is made up of 129 coins and includes 118 different coin designs and 51 different European mints. The hoard was discovered by two metal detectorists in a west Norfolk farmer's field between 2014 and 2020. Charles Bingham-Newland, chair of the Friends of the Norwich Museums, said: ""The hoard will add immeasurably to our knowledge of the Anglo-Saxon period."" The museum has been able to acquire the hoard with funding by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Art Fund and The Wolfson Foundation. The collection is believed to most contain Frankish tremisses which were minted in the Merovingian Frankish kingdoms that occupied modern-day France, Germany, Switzerland and the Low Countries. They are said to be the first coins made and used in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire and predate the first gold coinage made in Anglo-Saxon England. The find is one of only eight hoards of this type of coin known from Europe and the third in the United Kingdom. When the coins were declared as treasure by a coroner's court in November 2021, Norwich Castlesaid it hoped to be able to acquire the hoard. At the time of their discovery, one finder notified the authorities whereas the other tried to sell a number of coins and wasjailed for 16 months. Prior to their discovery, the largest hoard of coins from the same period was a purse of 101 coins discovered in Crondall, Hampshire, in 1828. Another purse found that contained 37 coins was discovered at the famous ship burial site in Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, which was excavated in 1939. Giving the coins to the museum will make sure they remain intact and accessible to researchers and visitors. Dr Tim Pestell, senior curator of archaeology at the castle, said: ""This internationally significant find reflects the wealth and continental connections enjoyed by the early Kingdom of East Anglia. ""Study of the hoard and its find spot has the potential to unlock our understanding of early trade and exchange systems and the importance of west Norfolk to East Anglia's ruling kings in the 7th Century."" The hoard going on display marks the reopening of Norwich Castle's Anglo-Saxon and Viking Gallery which has been closed for several years while work to transform the castle's Norman Keep has been under way.

985933,Moon dust 'rarer than gold' arrives in UK from China,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3krykxypo,"The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China. The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as ""more precious than gold dust"". ""Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,"" he says. After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago. China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons Rümker. A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia. It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race. Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries. The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe. ""It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,"" he said. He returned to the UK with the precious cargo in the safest place he could think of - his hand luggage. At his lab at the Open University in Milton Keynes, we step onto sticky mats to clean our shoes and put on plastic gloves, gowns, hair nets and hoods. The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination. If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specks, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do.  We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace. Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom. That is the Moon dust. It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey. And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total. ""Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,"" he adds. In a lab down the corridor, technician Kay Knight will be the first person to actually work on the grains when the vials are opened. She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface. ""I'm extremely excited,"" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade. ""But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,"" she adds. After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs. In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires. Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases. This is completely unique, and is one of the reasons Prof Anand believes his lab was chosen to receive the rare samples. James Malley, a research technician, operates a machine that can work out how much oxygen is contained within the specs of dust. He shows us a test run of what he will do. ""I'm going to hit that grain on the tray with a laser,"" he says, showing the scene magnified on a computer screen. ""It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,"" he says. The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples. But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission. In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows. ""I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,"" says Prof Anand. ""A lot of us built our careers working on samples returned by Apollo missions, and I think this is a fantastic tradition to follow. I hope that other countries will follow suit,"" he adds.

752195,Mosquito-borne killer disease threatens blackbirds,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3x6v05ly6o,"A mosquito-borne disease freshly arrived in Britain has spread large distances, with scientists racing to understand the risks to wild birds. Infected insects can spread the deadly Usutu virus to blackbirds, raising fears for the famous songsters. New data shows Usutu has spread across much of southern England in five years, and has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations. Scientists are monitoring its spread amid warnings that mosquitoes and the diseases they carry may expand their range under climate change. ""We've seen that the virus has spread further than we thought it might do, and it's persisted,"" Dr Arran Folly of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) told the BBC.  Scientists at the APHA in Weybridge, Surrey, have been tracking mosquito-borne diseases in wild birds for decades, amidwarningsthat climate change is turning Europe into a potential breeding ground for the insects. Longer summers, hotter temperatures and heavy rainfall are creating conditions for the nuisance insects to move into areas that were previously inhospitable to them. Until 2020, all results came back clear.  Then, after the summer heatwave of that year, Usutu was detected in several blackbirds in Greater London. ""Blackbirds specifically are quite susceptible to the virus and since 2020 we've found a decline in blackbirds of approximately 40% in Greater London,"" said Dr Folly. ""It gives an indication that in the future we might get other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes emerging in the UK."" Diseases such as Usutu are a growing threat to wild birds, amid a host of other pressures, including habitat loss, climate change and pesticide use.  The latest data shows that Usutu has spread further than the scientists expected. It has now been detected in wild birds across much of southern England, at least as far west as Dorset and as far north as Cambridgeshire. How big a risk Usutu poses to wild birds is uncertain. The virus has been linked to mass die-offs of blackbirds elsewhere in Europe, though that doesn't seem to be the case in Britain. And the blackbird remains one of the commonest garden birds with numbers holding steady in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas, and in the north.  To untangle the puzzle – and gather more data on blackbird numbers – the scientists have joined forces with the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). They are calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens over the summer  months to find out more about the comings and goings of the birds. Around now blackbirds are breeding and raising their young, frequently seen hopping along the ground and singing from the branches of trees on summer evenings. Lucy Love, a garden birdwatch ambassador for the BTO, knows the blackbirds in her gardens by sight and has grown fond of them. ""They're beautiful birds – intelligent, friendly and they have the most beautiful song with a lovely melodic tone to it,"" she explained. ""And we cannot lose them – they're a vital part of our ecosystem."" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

369683,Soviet-era spacecraft 'likely' to have re-entered Earth's atmosphere,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9vz28nyedo,"Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft is likely to have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere after being stuck in orbit for more than half a century, the European Space Agency said. Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit and instead broke into four pieces that have been circling the planet for more than five decades. The EU Space Surveillance and Tracking centre (SST) said one fragment - believed to be the lander - ""most likely"" re-entered the atmosphere at about 06:16 GMT (07:16 BST) on Saturday. It is unclear whether the object fell to the ground or burned up in the atmosphere. It is also unclear exactly where the object re-entered the atmosphere. While there is much experts do not know about the object's re-entry, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to have caused significant damage. ""It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris,"" Stijn Lemmens, a senior analyst at the European Space Agency, said. Kosmos 482's lander capsule was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it had a robust heat shield and durable structure. This is why experts think it may have survived an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere. However, Kosmos 482's parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely to have degraded after more than 50 years in space. Mr Lemmens explained that the ""re-entry of human-made objects into Earth's atmosphere occurs quite frequently"". He said it happens weekly for bigger spacecraft and daily for smaller ones. Objects typically burn up in the earth's atmosphere before they reach the ground. China's Long March 5B boosterre-entered over the Indian Ocean in 2022, and theTiangong-1 space stationmostly burned up over the Pacific in 2018.

1080760,'Foxes using school playground as a toilet',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c249qgjlyn9o,"A primary school says it is exploring ways to humanely remove foxes from the grounds due to safety concerns. Fran Rhodes, the principal at Hartsholme Academy in Lincoln, said foxes had been encroaching on the site for 12 years and had used playing fields and other areas ""as a toilet"". ""The priority is the safety of our children, we've done a risk assessment and the amount of diseases that's carried in the fox faeces is a concern for us,"" she said. The RSPCA said there were ""some risks"" associated with fox faeces, but deterrent measures might be more effective than removing the animals, as others might take their place. Ms Rhodes said the school was ""reviewing the situation"" and would contact animal specialists for advice. Her top priority was the children's health and safety, especially as the school cared for young children from the age of three. She recalled an incident in 2024 when an adult fox entered the school field and a site manager attempted to usher it away. ""But it ran the opposite way and over the nursey gate,"" Ms Rhodes said. ""Thankfully the children had just gone in. ""Those are the situations that really concern me, which is why I felt like we needed to do something to sort this out."" According to Ms Rhodes, the school's site manager is called out every day to collect fox faeces. ""We have fox poo and urine everywhere, it does become a bit of an issue."" Messages seen by the BBC in a community social media group with more than 50,000 members raised questions about the welfare of the foxes, including the use of traps on school grounds. Ms Rhodes said she ""understood"" the concerns. Traps had been used previously, but she wanted to assure people that they were ""humane"". The school was now seeking specialist advice from animal experts. Graham Le Blond, 65, who runs a non-lethal fox control business, Fox-A-Gon, said schools could be an ""attraction for a fox"" and outside learning areas often appealed to them. ""They contain decking or sheds, which is what the vast majority of foxes now live underneath,"" he said. ""They're ideal locations."" Mr Le Blond said the animals were ""creatures of habit"" and removing them involved ""changing their pattern"". Rebecca Machin, a scientific and policy officer at the RSPCA, said there were ""some risks"" associated with fox faeces, which ""can contain toxoplasmosis or round worm"". However, she warned that if the school removed the foxes, it was ""likely"" that others would take their place. ""We would say the best thing is to try deterrent measures, these are more likely to succeed in the long term,"" she added. Ms Machin recommend removing any sources of food and ensuring fencing was secure. According to the NHS, toxocariasis is an infection caused by small worms found in faeces. Although rare, it can cause ""serious problems like difficulty breathing or loss of vision"", the NHS website states.

74712,Why the mighty Himalayas are getting harder and harder to see,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdl092jj5o,"I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth. Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck. The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region. And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies. Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport. The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day – but there was no such day during my two-week stay. Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist. ""I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,"" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996. ""Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here."" During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region – but had hardly any luck there either. Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly. Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change. June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low. Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best. But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December. Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business. ""In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,"" she added An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a ""major let-down"". ""It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,"" said John Carrol. Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble. ""Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,"" he told the BBC. On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before. ""We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,"" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand. However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again. The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities. But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen. ""The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,"" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency. South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world. Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures. Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round. This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal. Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing. ""Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,"" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC. In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology. Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region. This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards. ""We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,"" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri. ""And there is nothing we can do about the haze."" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.Sign up here.

798006,Festival to include walks of discovery on Dartmoor,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3x12p00qo,"A new festival celebrating Dartmoor has been created to explore all aspects of the history and culture of the landscape, organisers say. From a place of inspiration for artists, to the role it has played in archaeologists' understanding of our ancestors, the Dartmoor Tors Festival is due to hold talks and walks looking at all aspects of moorland life. Writer Sophie Pierce and artist Alex Murdin have lived together on the moor for 25 years and said they wanted to find a way to help more people experience it for themselves. The event, during the last bank holiday weekend in May, will take place at the Ashburton Arts Centre, with walks across Dartmoor. Ms Pierce said:  ""Topics range from archaeology, to right to roam and how artists have perceived Dartmoor. ""It has so many layers of interest; history, folklore and culture. ""I think, perhaps, those of us who live locally are probably maybe a little bit guilty of not really appreciating it... We really want to spread the joy of this amazing place."" The seeds of this festival were planted during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Alex started drawing the tors he had known most of his life but could not visit during lockdown. The pictures became the inspiration for a guide book about Dartmoor's granite tors called Rock Idols, written with his wife Sophie. When the couple started walking to 28 of them to research the book, they rediscovered all sorts of facts and stories about landscape that they wanted to share with other people, and so the Dartmoor Tors Festival was born. Alex said: ""During lockdown, I was focused on the place I lived... but I couldn't get out on the moor... so I started drawing the tors and got a better understanding of what they meant to me and the place I live in."" The festival aims to get more people out on Dartmoor by guiding them on themed walks. Archaeologist Alan Endacott is running a walk from Belstone called Dartmoor's Newest Prehistory. It was an opportunity for members of the public to see the stone circles that he identified for the first time on a dig last year, he said. The money from the ticket sales from his walk would go towards paying for the carbon dating of the charcoal that he discovered, helping further his research, he said. At there other end of the spectrum, storytellers and performers Sara Hurley and Lisa Schneidau will be running a walk near Hound Tor. Their event, Myths of the Moor, plans to bring to life the route guided by Gillian Healey with stories such as Kitty Jay's grave. Lisa said: ""Before anything was written down, before anything was recorded, everyone was telling stories. ""That was the way to pass down wisdom or provide entertainment."" The Beltane Boarder Morris and musician Seth Lakeman are also among the acts that will be performing from the 23-25 May. Surreal Succulents' boss Daniel Michael says he is ""over the moon"" to win the award again. Officers are called to the A38 at Eggbuckland after reports of an injured deer on the central reservation.

1087437,Path and lights to be built through nature reserve,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mr92mdnzxo,"A new walking and cycling path will be built through a nature reserve despite protests from wildlife activists. Newcastle City Council has approved plans for a route through the Havannah Nature Reserve, to connect the Great Park estate to Hazlerigg. The planned asphalt walkway sparked strong objections from environmental campaigners, with fears the lights that will line the path could have damaging consequences for a number of species within the sanctuary. But the local authority's planning committee approved the Newcastle Great Park Consortium's proposals on Friday after hearing the track was essential for the opening of the new Great Park Academy school building. More than 1,600 people signed a petition by Save Newcastle Wildlife opposing the scheme. A spokesperson for the group told the BBC the decision was ""devastating to see"" as removing habitat and installing 5m high (8.5ft) LED lighting posts would cause ""significant harm"". ""Trees and vegetation are going to be removed and lighting will be installed through the reserve and along the southern boundary, which is a key foraging route for bats,"" they said. ""Great crested newts will be impacted as well as Alder Signaller moths, badgers and otters. ""The route could have avoided the nature reserve entirely with a bit more planning. It's a shame alternatives weren't given more consideration."" During the meeting, Hazlerigg Parish Council's Sheila Barbour said she supported efforts to facilitate active travel ""but not at the expense of the natural environment"". Calling for a ""safe and less environmentally harmful"" option to be pursued, she claimed the path would end in an unlit field - close to a car park which is a ""notorious dogging area"". However, the Gosforth Group Multi-Academy Trust argued the pathway was critical for pupils who will attend Great Park Academy once its new building opens later this year. Corinne Raybould, the trust's chief projects officer, said the existing wagonway through the reserve was uneven and prone to flooding, making it unsuitable for hundreds of youngsters to rely on for access to school. The council's planning committee granted permission for the project, which was a requirement of previous approvals for the building of Great Park estate itself, by eight votes to one. Councillors heard 196 trees would be planted next to the former Sage offices to make up for the environmental damage done to the nature reserve, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. In addition to the route through the Havannah sanctuary, plans were also approved for another foot and cycle path on land to the south of the former Sage offices on Wagonway Drive as well as the replacement of two existing bridges over the River Ouseburn.

822352,Nursery wins fifth gold at Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy900ldndw4o,"A nursery from Cornwall has won its fifth consecutive gold medal at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Penzance-based Surreal Succulents bagged the top prize for its exhibition of Succulents, a plant well known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions. Boss Daniel Michael said he was ""over the moon"" with the judges' decision and highlighted the effort of his team to ""grow, water, build, and put everything together"". The group has won gold at each of the last five shows, including the RHS Plant of the Year award in 2022. ""We walked into Chelsea this morning and were nervous but when we arrived we were relieved to see that lovely gold medal,"" Mr Michael toldBBC Radio Cornwall. He said the nursery's exhibition featured some plants which had been grown over the course of 15 years and some were a little more complicated to transport. ""It's quite difficult to get tall succulents into displays especially because you have to get them all the way from Cornwall and they risk falling over in the van when we drive over speed bumps in London. ""We carefully packed them in and held them in place with a soft tie to not damage the stems,"" he added. ""We also grow our succulents a bit tougher, so during in the winter we won't give them as much heat. We'll keep them as cold as possible so they don't go leggy and we'll give them as much light as possible to control their growth.""

795232,"Why scientists are counting tiny marine creatures, from Space",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g41845jdo,"Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space. The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet. Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures. However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures. ""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK. ""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk."" Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica. The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it. Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect. ""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement."" This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space. Krill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them. They are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill,  krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants. However, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable. Mr Downie said: ""We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas. ""[This project could] give us a new tool to help monitor and safeguard this vital species."" The government is due to consider proposals for swift bricks in all new-build homes as numbers plummet.

787949,Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8074ry1yr5o,"As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest. A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. ""I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,"" he said. "" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action."" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Though not officially classed as a ""big cat"" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. ""Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,"" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. ""Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,"" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. ""Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,"" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. ""If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,"" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. ""Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,"" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. ""Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals."" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. ""We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements."" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

1076627,Sandeel fishing ban to remain in place,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgrwxxzxkjo,"A challenge to Britain's ban on commercial fishing for sandeels in the North Sea has been dismissed in an international court. Sandeels are a vital source of food for marine life including seabirds that live along the UK coastline. Two bans for English and Scottish waters were put in place in early 2024 to prohibit trawlers netting the tiny fish, following concerns that sandeel stocks were becoming too low. Judges at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) based in The Hague ruled there is no legal obligation to reverse the closure order after the EU claimed the move was ""discriminatory and disproportionate"", and could threaten the future of commercial sandeel fishing in Denmark. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which manages Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire, was one of several conservation organisations that called for the measure to remain in place andgave evidence in the court hearing. Beccy Speight, the RSPB's chief executive, said: ""We are absolutely delighted the panel has found the ecological case for the closure of industrial sandeel fishing is sound."" ""Safeguarding sandeel stocks is a key part of the jigsaw that will help set our puffins, kittiwakes and the wider marine environment on the path to recovery."" The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)welcomedthe court's decision and said it had found ""the UK successfully demonstrated that the measures taken to close English and Scottish waters were based on the best available science"". Sandeels comprise a number of species of small fish and are caught commercially for use in animal feed and in oil production. Danish fishing organisations had argued that the North Sea ban was ""unnecessary"" and claimed sandeel stocks were plentiful, disputing the scientific evidence. Speaking before the court ruling Esben Sverdrup-Jensen, from the Danish Pelagic Producers' Association, said the ban had a ""massive impact"" on the industry. ""It means we have lost about half of the fishing grounds that we have traditionally fished on for decades,"" he said. Mr Sverdrup-Jensen disputed the claim that sandeel stocks were under threat. ""Sandeel is probably the best managed fishery in the world,"" he added. The ruling means a sandeel fishing ban also remains in place in the Scottish areas of the North Sea and this has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which has continuingconcerns about the seabird population. Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary, Mairi Gougeon, said: ""Protecting our marine ecosystem is vital to Scotland's environment, and to the people and communities who rely on it. ""The ruling reaffirms the appropriateness of the actions we took last year to do just that."" The Permanent Court of Arbitrationruling, which runs to nearly 300 pages, also stated the ban in English waters breached the post-Brexit trade deal because it was ""disproportionate"". In a statement, the European Commission said it welcomed the ruling as it ""provides clarity"" on fishing rights. It said: ""The UK is required to immediately comply with the final ruling and shall inform the EU within 30 days of the [compliance] measures it will take"". A Defra spokesperson said it would ""bring the UK into compliance"" on this issue but the ruling did not mean the UK is legally obliged to reverse the closure of English waters.

925737,"Coastlines in danger even if climate target met, scientists warn",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj93e40znl3o#comments,"The world could see hugely damaging sea-level rise of several metres or more over the coming centuries even if the ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5C is met, scientists have warned. Nearly 200 countries have pledged to try to keep the planet's warming to 1.5C, but the researchers warn that this should not be considered ""safe"" for coastal populations. They drew their conclusion after reviewing the most recent studies of how the ice sheets are changing - and how they have changed in the past. But the scientists stress that every fraction of a degree of warming that can be avoided would still greatly limit the risks. The world's current trajectory puts the planet on course for nearly 3C of warming by the end of the century, compared with the late 1800s, before humans began burning large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. That's based on current government policies to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other polluting activities. But even keeping to 1.5C would still lead to continued melting of Greenland and Antarctica, as temperature changes can take centuries to have their full impact on such large masses of ice, the researchers say. ""Our key message is that limiting warming to 1.5C would be a major achievement - it should absolutely be our target - but in no sense will it slow or stop sea-level rise and melting ice sheets,"" said lead author Prof Chris Stokes, a glaciologist at Durham University. The2015 Paris climate agreementsaw the world's nations agree to keep global temperature rises ""well below"" 2C - and ideally 1.5C. That has often been oversimplified to mean 1.5C is ""safe"", something glaciologists have cautioned against for years. The authors of the new paper, published in the journalCommunications Earth and Environment, draw together three main strands of evidence to underline this case. First, records of the Earth's distant past suggest significant melting – with sea levels several metres higher than present - during previous similarly warm periods, such as 125,000 years ago. And the last time there was as much planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as today - about 3 million years ago - sea levels were about 10-20m higher. Second, current observations already show an increasing rate of melting, albeit with variation from year to year. ""Pretty dramatic things [are] happening in both west Antarctica and Greenland,"" said co-author Prof Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre. East Antarctica appears, for now at least, more stable. ""We're starting to see some of those worst case scenarios play out almost in front of us,"" added Prof Stokes. Finally, scientists use computer models to simulate how ice sheets may respond to future climate. The picture they paint isn't good. ""Very, very few of the models actually show sea-level rise slowing down [if warming stabilises at 1.5C], and they certainly don't show sea-level rise stopping,"" said Prof Stokes. The major concern is that melting could accelerate further beyond ""tipping points"" due to warming caused by humans - though it's not clear exactly how these mechanisms work, and where these thresholds sit. ""The strength of this study is that they use multiple lines of evidence to show that our climate is in a similar state to when several metres of ice was melted in the past,"" said Prof Andy Shepherd, a glaciologist at Northumbria University, who was not involved in the new publication. ""This would have devastating impacts on coastal communities,"" he added. An estimated 230 million people live within one metre of current high tide lines. Defining a ""safe"" limit of warming is inherently challenging, because some populations are more vulnerable than others. But if sea-level rise reaches a centimetre a year or more by the end of the century - mainly because of ice melt and warming oceans - that could stretch even rich countries' abilities to cope, the researchers say. ""If you get to that level, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation strategies, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed [in modern civilisation],"" argued Prof Bamber. However, this bleak picture is not a reason to stop trying, they say. ""The more rapid the warming, you'll see more ice being lost [and] a higher rate of sea-level rise much more quickly,"" said Prof Stokes. ""Every fraction of a degree really matters for ice sheets.""

1093392,Can this lynx born in a zoo learn to live in the wild?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8074ry1yr5o#comments,"As the door of its crate opens, the lynx sniffs the air, checks the coast is clear and cautiously takes its first steps toward freedom in Germany's Black Forest. A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction. But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany. Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home. ""I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,"" he said. "" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action."" Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. Though not officially classed as a ""big cat"" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. ""Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,"" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom. It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. ""Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,"" Dina says. To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males. So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available. ""Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,"" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem. ""If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,"" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-Württemberg told us. We're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills. There are puncture marks on its throat – a sure sign. ""Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,"" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction. ""Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals."" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. ""We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements."" The final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring.

86157,The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it. One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b. Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection. ""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species? Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens. It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope. But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star. Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look. Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system. Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered. Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life. But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy. As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious. The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures. And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes. Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp. But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.) Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert. It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors. Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world. Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means. Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal. ""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"". The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time. In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time. A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue. The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way. The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome. China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces. But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London. ""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing. ""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"". Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"". Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life. Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn? ""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight. ""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply. If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there. Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step."" Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life. ""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms. ""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?"" He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos. As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says. Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul. ""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe. ""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"". Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan. ""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene. ""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues. ""It will be another step in our evolution"".

362953,National Park will not object to gas drill plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7gvjz45lvo#comments,"Planners at the North York Moors National Park Authority have said they will not object to proposals to drill for gas on nearby land. Europa Oil and Gas Ltd has submitted a planning application for the temporary plant near Burniston, north of Scarborough. The ""proppant squeeze"" project, which would include a 30m (98ft) drilling rig, hasprompted demonstrations from local residents. However, members of the authority said the site's impact on the national park would be ""limited"" because it was 800m away. A report added that a ""degree of harm"" caused by the direct visibility of the development had been considered. However, it said: ""Subject to clarification of certain matters and subject to imposition of appropriate controls, it is however concluded that this relatively short-term development would not lead to significant harm to the delivery of national park statutory purposes, or to national park special qualities."" The committee did ask for clarification on issues including the time that the test rig would be in place, and the proposed route of HGVs visiting the site. According to the planning application, the site potentially has significant gas resource. If the tests were successful, a new application would be submitted for a more permanent drill site, it said. The meeting heard the 30m (98ft) drilling rig would be part of a ""proppant squeeze"" test project, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Europa Oil and Gashas previously saidthat a ""slurry"" would be injected into the well to fracture surrounding rocks, allowing more gas to be recovered. The technique, which has been described as ""small-scale fracking"", has been accused by some of being a loophole in the UK's moratorium on the controversial fossil fuel extraction process. However, proppant squeeze procedures have been regularly used in the UK for a number of years and industry experts consider the technique low-volume, unlike the process formally termed 'hydraulic fracturing'. About 70 members of the public attended a meeting last month, where members of Burniston Parish Council voted to object to the scheme. Listen to highlights fromNorth Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latestepisode of Look North. The new mayor for Greater Lincolnshire says she will be meeting with a fracking company. An exploratory drilling site in Salford where police and protesters clashed in 2014 is to fully close. More than 200 residents and supporters marched through Burniston, near Scarborough, to oppose plans. Europa Oil & Gas wants to drill for gas at Burniston, near the North York Moors National Park. The process of extracting gas, known as fracking, is facing a complete ban by the government. Copyright 2025 BBC.

885901,Dig resumes to uncover more Norman castle remains,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqe7xjd48do,"An archaeological dig to uncover more of a hidden Norman castle in West Sussex is set to resume. Excavation work at Chichester's Priory Park has so far unveiled evidence of remains dating back to the 11th Century, including a military causeway and bridge. Following a series of geophysics and ground-penetrating radar scans, the work has most recently concentrated on the discovery of a ditch to the east of the city site. An open day for members of the public to find out more will take place on 31 May. The latest dig will run from Tuesday until 3 June. The project is a collaboration between Chichester and District Archaeology Society and Chichester District Council (CDC), with council archaeologist James Kenny leading it. ""We are very excited to welcome back the team to Priory Park,"" said Bill Brisbane, CDC's cabinet member for planning. ""Their work over the past few years has been vital in helping understand the rich history that lies beneath it."" He said as the dig progressed a tray of finds would be displayed for people to view and handle, while it was hoped some remains could go on permanent public display within the park. In 2017 three well-preserved Roman buildings, along with some accompanying baths, were found on the site. It is thought the structures, two of which would have been houses, were owned by people of importance. Archaeologists said the only reason they survived was because Priory Park, which was originally home to a monastery, was never built on. Chichester's Roman name was Noviomagus Reginorum, which translates to New Market of the Regini - a reference to the Regni tribe which inhabited the area.

1103738,Astronauts Butch and Suni begin journey home after nine months in space,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k0d55q24o,"After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finallyon their way home. Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems. The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) . Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough. It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy. The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C. As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity. Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean. Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it. ""They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,"" she told BBC News. The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024. They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing. But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home. Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return. So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September. It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now. The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return – and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end. The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space. They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station. And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were. Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency. Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended. ""We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,"" he said. Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission. ""I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,"" she said. ""I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow."" The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner. But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs. Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission. ""It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,"" he told BBC News. ""And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars…. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'."" Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts. Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight. It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets. Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space. ""I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,"" he told the BBC. ""It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss."" The BBC meets astronaut Rosemary Coogan who is training at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas.

487805,White storks hatch in Cornwall in rewilding plan,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80k543ezrpo,"A farmer is nurturing a brood of white stork chicks as part of a charity's aim to reintroduce them in the county. Yan Swiderski has welcomed eight stork chicks from the adults he keeps in a woodland near Wadebridge as part of work by the Cornwall Stork Project. Wildlife expert Chris Packham said the project was ""exciting"" as it would ""hopefully recolonise Cornwall"" with the birds. Thefirst wild white stork chicks in the UK for hundreds of years hatchedat the Knepp Estate in West Sussex in 2020. Wildlife expert Chris Packham said reintroducing storks was ""something that's not easy to do"". He said: ""You can't just get some storks and let them go in the UK because they will only return to where they were hatched. ""This is what is so exciting about the storks in Wadebridge. ""Because those storks have hatched there, when they're released they'll have a yearn to return to Wadebridge or the surrounding area which will mean they will hopefully recolonise Cornwall."" White storkshave been seen flying across Cornwallas they migrate south.  Mr Packham said migration was tough as some storks could be hunted and some affected by natural catastrophes. ""This is a project which needs to run for a number of years to get those numbers up because there will be natural mortality. ""So the idea that all eight of these storks that migrate away when they're released will make it back is a little fanciful."" Storks are slow to mature, he added, so breeding would take a while.

Thames Valley Police was called to Lodge Lake, Milton Keynes, on Thursday, after reports the eggs were smashed between 17:00 BST and 17:25. MK Swan Rescue - which usually has volunteers watching the nest - said the eggs were destroyed by teenagers last year. Allie Humphries, director and senior rescuer at the charity, said: ""The whole team are deflated. We tried so hard."" In 2023, the eggs were destroyed after heavy rainfall caused the area to flood. The charity said vandals targeted them in 2024, and then earlier this year, a clutch of eggs from the same pair went missing. Ms Humphries said volunteers had agreed to take turns watching the nest, but for an hour it was left unguarded the eggs were destroyed. ""People want to look after them No matter what we do somebody is hurting them,"" said Ms Humphries. ""They're not doing any harm, they just want to raise their young.""

298079,Second endangered bongo calf born at safari park,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ngvd78d5o,"The birth of a second mountain bongo in captivity in the UK has been described by zookeepers as ""a major success"" for the breeding programme. Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire said the male calf's arrival was vital for the breed's future andfollowed the birth of another malethere in October after a six-year breeding gap. This type of antelope is listed as critically endangered in the wild, where it is believed fewer than 80 remain. The park said the newest calf needed physiotherapy shortly after his birth on 5 May to strengthen his hips and rear legs but was now doing well. The calves' mothers Odongo and Othaya were born at Woburn in August 2014 and are one of only two surviving pairs of bongo twins ever recorded in captivity. Keepers said they were inseparable and continued to support each other as parents. Their two young calves have already formed a bond, with nose-to-nose greetings and close interactions observed. Woburn's head of section Tom Robson said: ""After a six-year breeding gap, two healthy calves were born within months of each other, marking a major success for the captive breeding programme.

First-time entrants Nick and Hannah Wade, from Gardeners Delight Nursery in Barnstaple, Devon, are just a few of up to 145,000 people visiting the iconic event over the next week. Their display will be competing for one of four types of medals, an outcome decided by the competition judging panels. Hannah said she was ""overwhelmed"" to finally be able to take part. ""My stress levels have now ceased because now we can stand back and look at our display, and I feel I can finally relax,"" said Hannah. The display includes many different types of the Geum plant species, such as the Totally Tangerine and the Prinses Juliana. She said: ""We wanted to plant planters for people with not much garden or no garden at all. ""You can use any size container and add a few flowers to helps the bees, butterflies and dragonflies, and, if everyone just had one plant by their front door, it would really help."" Nick said that, despite the process of organising, actually executing the plan was a ""hectic"" affair. He said: ""We did the five-hour drive, unloaded the vans, and at 10pm turned up at our accommodation, only to realise the host wouldn't answer to give us the key code to get in. ""We managed to book another hotel for one night, but got ourselves locked in Battersea Park along the way. ""We then had to climb the railings to get out, and, after accidentally leaving one of our bags in the park, we finally got to our room at one in the morning.""

331763,The wonderful wildlife in Belfast that will be captured on camera,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98p31x06ewo,"Despite being a large city, Belfast is home to a surprising amount of wildlife. Television presenter Iolo Williams is determined to seek out its rich and varied urban characters and meet the people keen to keep the city wonderfully wild. ""It's always good when you visit somewhere which has got a big population with wildlife in the middle of it, because most people now live in towns and in cities,"" he said. Williams will be undertaking a three-week nature trek through some of Northern Ireland's most diverse wildlife hotspots as part of the 20th anniversary of BBC Springwatch. The series will return to BBC Two and BBC iPlayer from Monday 26 May, led by Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan. There will be three weeks of live programmes set in the National Trust's Longshaw Estate in the heart of the Peak District but it will also feature three places in Northern Ireland: Belfast, Rathlin Island and Mount Stewart in County Down. Williams added: ""It's great for us to show things like golden eagles and white-tailed eagles and basking sharks, but wildlife for most people is what they see in their gardens or in their local parks or in town."" After Belfast, Williams will travel by ferry to Rathlin Island, a biodiversity hotspot and Northern Ireland's most northerly point. It is a vital breeding ground for a variety of seabirds and home to endemic species such as the mysterious golden hare. Williams will also hope to hear the call of the rare corncrake. Williams said: ""It's a migratory bird which 100, 120 years ago was really common. It's now declining throughout its range in Europe. ""It has disappeared from Wales, hanging on in one or two places in England, and just hanging on in the wilder parts of the west coast, mainly of Scotland, and it's holding on in Ireland as well."" At Mount Stewart, Williams will introduce viewers to a range of wildlife. There are 10,000 recorded species at Mount Stewart which has diverse woodlands, ghost ponds, rough farmland fields, twisting hedgerows, and a tidal lough scattered with green islands. Throughout the series, live nest-cameras rigged across springtime locations will tell the story of the season alongside a range of pre-recorded films, which have been capturing moments of spring 2025. Springwatch will continue to reveal an insight into the lives of wildlife, and with 20 years behind it, the programme will build a clear picture of how wildlife has changed since it began filming as well as make some predictions for its future.

934017,New plan for bins and recycling to be considered,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg1lxmv2eo,"Weekly household food waste collections and changes to bins and recycling are being considered by Lancaster City Council. All councils are being told to follow a government ""simpler recycling"" scheme which aims to create consistent waste collection and recycling arrangements to reduce the use of landfill tips and to recycle more materials like paper, tins, glass and plastics. Also food waste can be used in some processes to generate heat energy or for fertilisers for farms and gardens. The council's cabinet will meet to decide the best way for the collections to be introduced in the district, possibly switching from the current recycling boxes to new wheelie bins. Larger bins would make it easier for households to store recyclables like glass, plastic, tins, cardboard and paper and reduce mess on the streets. If the proposals get the green light, recycling collections would move to every three weeks instead of every two, because there will be more space in each bin. The same three-week cycle is also being proposed for non-recyclable waste, with the expectation that people throw away less once they start recycling food waste weekly. Paul Hart, cabinet member for environmental services, said: ""I know these are big changes, but other councils that have already made the switch are seeing less waste and more being recycled. ""That's what we're aiming for too."" The city council has received around £1.46m from the government to support food waste collections.

A 675-acre (273-hectare) plot of land around Mendlesham, near Stowmarket, has been earmarked forthe major White Elm project. Conservative-controlled Suffolk County Council said it would object to the proposal if high quality farmland was affected. But Spanish firm Elmya RPC UK Grange Road Ltd, which is expected to submit plans in 2026, said it would power more than 40,000 homes a year. Labour's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will have the final say on the plans. A consultation began on Monday and is due to run until 30 June. The White Elm site, which also surrounds Wickham Skeith and Thwaite, sits five miles (8km) south of anotherproposed solar farm in Yaxley. ""I'm sure the reaction of many Suffolk residents will be 'here we go again',"" said Conservative councillor Richard Rout. He warned the application would move ""very quickly"" and urged residents to voice their concerns. ""Do object and give clear reasons why, but also make constructive suggestions to amend and improve the plans in case it goes ahead,"" Rout added. In a statement, the county council said solar farms ""should not remove Suffolk's best quality farmland"" from food production. Concerns have also been raised about where a substation would be built for the development, which is expected to have a 40-year lifespan. A spokesman for Elmya RPC UK Grange Road Ltd' said it was in the early stages of shaping the solar farm.

391880,Will 2025 be a sweet year for strawberry growers and consumers?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rpn41wxdqo,"The UK's strawberry season is off to a ""stonking start"", according to one grower, with warm days and cooler nights meaning they are sweeter than usual. Marion Regan, managing director of Kent-based Hugh Lowe Farms, told the BBC that a ""glorious spring"" this year had contributed to a ""really good crop"" of the fruit. That is good news for strawberry lovers, including those attending Wimbledon this year - one of Hugh Lowe Farms' clients. This spring is currently ranking asthe driest in over a century, according to the Met Office, with the Environment Agency recently warning there is a ""medium"" risk of a summer drought. Ms Regan, who has been growing strawberries for more than 50 years, said she was noticing that this year's were a ""good size"" so far but that the ""most marked thing"" was their sweetness. A combination of warm days and cool nights are known to make strawberries sweeter. The lower night temperatures allow them to rest and put the energy they have gained during the day into producing more natural sugars. However, Ms Regan said it remained to be seen what the rest of their growing season - which lasts until November - would bring. Asked about the warnings over potential drought conditions, she said that she, like all good soft fruit growers, have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather and to ensure their crops get a steady supply with water. Nevertheless, some help from mother nature would not go amiss. ""All farmers could do with the rain, it would be nice,"" she added. Pauline Goodall, a strawberry farmer from Limington in Somerset, told the BBC earlier this month that a warmer than average start to May was having a noticeable effect on the timing of this year's harvest. ""They're just ripening at a phenomenal rate,"" she said of her strawberries. The Summer Berry Company, based in Colworth near Chichester, recently said that the warmer weather had helped increase its production to 200 tonnes – 50 tonnes more than by the same time last year - and that the plants were producing ""lush-sweet tasting fruit"". This all bodes well for consumers keen to get their berry fix over summer, but how should we be making the most of these sweet flavours? While some people may prefer to keep it classic with cream, there are other options available for those who are looking to be more adventurous. According to the BBC Food,a little black pepper or balsamic vinegar helps to give them more flavour, while pairing them with some form of chilli can help balance the flavours out. This year marks a very different start to the strawberry-growing season than in 2024, when the fruit was delayed in ripening following one of the wettest winters on record. Scientists have saidclimate change was a major factorin this weather. It is also well-established that human-caused climate change is making spells of hot weather more likely, and that hot days have become more common in the UK. Over the decade 2014-2023, days exceeded 28C more than twice as often as the 1961-1990 average, according to the Met Office. BBC Weather forecaster Chris Fawkes saidthe coming weekshould provide some good strawberry-growing weather with long spells of sunshine and cool nights. A few showers could come in the first half of the week, and some could turn to thunder and hail, which would not be welcomed by growers although the risk to individual farms would be very low. A change in weather patterns next weekend and the following week would lead to rain becoming widespread, which would ""probably welcomed by farmers given that this spring is likely to be the driest in over a century"", he added. We have been answering questions on the trade deal submitted via Your Voice, Your BBC News. Thousands of people are expected to attend, with four days of sunshine forecast. Agricultural workers are being reminded that dust particles can lead to serious lung damage. The University of Exeter hopes research can help improve support provided for health and wellbeing.

395164,'Beach clean has been eye-opening' - dolphin volunteer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c771rpnzpy0o,"A Sussex man says his latest conservation fundraiser has been ""eye-opening"" as he prepares to walk, cycle and paddleboard thousands of kilometres while cleaning litter off the south coast's beaches. Ben Boxer, 26, has been walking and paddle-boarding over 1,500km (932 miles), including hiking home from work in London, to raise funds for the Marine Conservation Society. The corporate sustainability consultant, from Brighton, is now continuing his mission with a 750kg beach cleaning target, having been inspired by his travels to Canada. Mr Boxer said: ""Starting to weigh what I have been picking up has been eye-opening. I have been picking up a lot of plastic fishing lines. ""The UK could be a lot like Canada if we restored some of the wildlife. I hope to see some of that when I go out in the summer."" Mr Boxer, who last year cycled over 7,500km (4,660 miles) in aid of the Sussex Dolphin Project for whom he volunteers, was inspired to take on the challenge through his long-distance relationship with his then-partner, who lived in Vancouver. His initial cycle challenge was designed to be the length of the flight from London to Vancouver – about 7,500km – and his latest set of events are also inspired by that distance. Mr Boxer says he is completing the challenges in increments and is roughly two- thirds of the way through the fundraiser, Movement for Nature, which he started in January. He said that this included walking back from his job in Paddington in London to Brighton via the Surrey Hills, High Weald and Lewes over the space of a weekend. He added that he plans to travel to Canada again later this year, where he plans to complete a mountain bike climb through the British Columbian mountains.

140931,Designer creates final garden for Chelsea Flower Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20qpq0dgd5o,"A multi-award winning garden designer created his tenth and final garden for the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Tom Hoblyn, who lives in Bardwell, Suffolk, designed a sensory garden for the end-of-life charity,Hospice UKcalledGarden of Compassion. ""I jumped at the chance at doing this,"" said Hoblyn, who has also designed gardens for children's hospicesHaven House, in Woodford Green, east London andThe Nook, near Norwich. ""There's a desperate shortage of gardens in hospices; they play a vital role in creating a positive atmosphere for end-of-life care."" Hoblyn said it was important to create a design for the show that ""grounds people in nature, and to activate all the senses"". ""Smell, sight, sound, touch is particularly important in a hospice garden,"" he added. The garden was inspired by Mediterranean themes, which allowed him to use very bright colours as well as heavily scented flowers, such as the Spanish broom, Spartium junceum. ""The fact you're using a lot of Mediterranean plants means you attract a lot of insects, so you get a lot of noise too,"" he said. While many gardeners may have been mourning the lack of rain this spring, Hoblyn's dry and hot garden has not. ""This is my 10th garden for Chelsea, and it's never been without rain before, so this is an absolute blessing, this is great,"" he said. Explaining why this was his final Chelsea garden, he said he had spent 18 months on the Garden of Compassion. ""It's a lot, and I do have real work I should be doing,"" he said. ""It's also time, we need more young people in horticulture, we need to make way [for them]."" He added he would now like to devote some time to mentoring young people for Chelsea. The designer has been involved with pieces at the London horticultural show for the past 25 years, winning many accolades. ""We've done well, but it's not just me - I just surround myself with the best people,"" he said. Looking back, he said his highlights included winning the People's Choice award at Chelsea in 2012, again for a Mediterranean garden. ""To get People's Choice is so rewarding, it's not just based on judges, but the people's views,"" he said. Hoblyn's garden was funded byProject Giving Back.

645640,Water voles are almost extinct - could glitter save them?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx08exwp97o,"Endangered water voles in Wales are being fed edible glitter in a bid to save them from extinction. Once commonly found across south Wales, water voles are now effectively extinct in all but a few locations, according to the Wildlife Trust. With their future hanging in the balance, conservationists have been looking for new ways to track the naturally shy individuals in the wild - which is where the glitter comes in. The Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) hopes that by offering the animals something sparkly to eat, the sparkle should come out the other end - providing some much-needed answers. Rob Parry, chief executive of INCC, said his team had consulted with vets to ensure the edible and biodegradable glitter - the type used to decorate cakes - would not be harmful to the semi-aquatic creatures. ""It's something that we've done in nature conservation before for other species, for badgers in particular where we use pellets to put in with peanuts, which badgers love,"" said Mr Parry. ""So we've taken that idea and scaled it down to water vole size, which means using glitter."" The hope is that if the water voles are willing to consume the glitter then it will come out in their poo, allowing the small mammals - which are often mistaken for brown rats - to be tracked by conservationists. Different colours of glitter could be used to allow conservationists to track different families of water voles and how far they range. It might sound like a fun idea, but Mr Parry and his team could not be more serious. If they can track where water voles are located in the wild, they can make adjustments to the environment - like removing invasive conifers from wetland habitats or fencing off certain riverbanks to stop sheep grazing. Measures like this could help the species to disperse through the landscape undisturbed and potentially be a life-saving intervention. ""We'll be able to see the types of territory, the size and where they go in,"" said Mr Parry. ""Are they just using the linear features, the ditches, or are they spreading out into the bog and the molinia grassland habitat? ""That will be really crucial for when it comes to planning for our upland habitats."" The team is first testing out their theory on some captive-bred water voles which are part of a wider Natural Resources Wales (NRW)  project to reintroduce colonies into the wild. The glitter is spread onto chunks of apple, not part of their normal diet in the wild, but a food the animals love and do well on in captivity, according to Richard Davies from NRW. ""They get everything they need from apples, carrots, and some dried rabbit food as well,"" he said. He has successfully bred hundreds of water voles which have been reintroduced into the wild, though he said their release was no guarantee of survival. ""Most predators in the UK would quite happily take a water vole. They need to be able to cope with this heavy predation and replace themselves a lot,"" he said. With a BBC News camera present, the glittery purple apple was placed on top of the straw bedding which covered the water voles' pen. After 20 minutes, the food remained untouched, but an hour later most of it had disappeared. The success of the project, however, does not just depend on the appetite of the water voles, but how well the glitter can retain its shine from end to end. Mr Parry said without interventions like this, the future for water voles was uncertain. ""It's been a perfect storm of bad things that's happened to water voles in the last few decades,"" he said. ""We have drained an awful lot of their wetland habitat, forced them into linear ditches where we find them now, and then the biggest problem is the American mink, an invasive species that was let out and released from pens and they just turned out to be the perfect water vole predators. The water voles don't stand a chance, really."" But now, at least, he is more hopeful. The water voles, known for being nervous about any changes to to their environment, had not rejected the glitter. So, did the experiment work? Just 24 hours later, a tiny glittery poo was spotted.

730518,Secrets of forgotten Egyptian tomb statue revealed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj434djvpgo,"A stone head that spent decades gathering dust on a wall has proved to be an Egyptian statue from an ancient tomb. The statue fragment was one of hundreds of pieces, from a fossilised shark tooth to wartime posters, collected by a Nottinghamshire doctor. When inspected, the relic was found to be mounted on a wooden board, which revealed it was 2,500 years old but also contained documents showing it was found in 1888 close to a ""lost"" pyramid. Valuer Richard Griza said: ""I saw it over my shoulder, and I almost couldn't believe my eyes - it is a privilege to handle such an item."" The artefact, measuring roughly 15cm (6in) square, is believed to be part of an ""ushabti"", a type of funerary figure which was intended to function as a helper in the afterlife. Made of volcanic basalt, it has been dated to the 26th Dynasty (circa 664-525BC). Mr Griza, from Arthur Johnson and Sons auctioneers, said the items had been collected by a local doctor. ""There were hundreds of items, and they were eclectic to say the least,"" he said. ""He seemed to have collected historical curios of all sorts, from sword handles to fossilised shark teeth. ""The head had been on a wall for decades, and the gentleman's niece said they didn't pay much attention to it; it was just another thing to dust."" It was only when taken off the wall, it was found the wooden mounting contained documents revealing more about its past. The paperwork, drawings, and letters of provenance show it was found during Flinders Petrie's 1888 excavations at Hawara. It came from the tomb of a great noble called Horuta, who was important enough to be buried close to the pyramid of pharaoh Amenemhat II, which has been largely destroyed over time. Mr Griza said: ""It is so rare to get an item with this provenance. ""We know where and when it was found, and it's so remarkable it was found by one of the pioneers in archaeology."" Sir Flinders Petrie, who lived from 1853 until 1942, is regarded as one of the most important and influential figures in the history of Egyptology. He pioneered a more scientific approach to both dating finds and regarding anything found on an excavation - no matter how mundane - as worthy of study. Some of the collection has already been sold, but the head goes under the hammer at Arthur Johnson and Sons auctioneers on 24 May with an estimate of £1,500 to £2,500.

611231,Sewage spill couple 'outraged' and out-of-pocket,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xgqvj1p2ro,"A water company has been criticised by a retired couple who said their front garden had been ruined by a sewage spill. The leak happened in Green Lane, Sonning Common, Oxfordshire, as workers tried to clear a blockage in a nearby street caused by a build-up of fat, oil and grease. Thames Water has agreed to remove pea gravel from the home that has been contaminated, as well as any plants, but it will not pay to reinstate the garden. It has left keen gardener Clare Talbot and her husband Malcolm facing a large bill or costly insurance claim. ""I was devastated,"" Mrs Talbot said. ""I've put so much time, energy and love into growing this garden, from scratch, over the last four years and quite a few plants could well be trashed."" Thames Water did jet wash the patio in the back garden following the spill on 28 April but the front garden is covered in pea gravel which the company has a policy of not removing or replacing. After Mrs Talbot complained to the company, it is now planning to clear away contaminated gravel as a ""gesture of goodwill"" but will not reinstate the garden. Mrs Talbot said it would likely cost up to a £1,000 to fix. The couple may be able to claim on their home insurance but they have an excess and worry about their premium rising as a result. ""I'm absolutely outraged, incensed, that a big company like that can just damage someone's private property and walk away,"" she said. ""It's astonishing."" In a statement, Thames Water said: ""We're very sorry that Ms Talbot experienced external sewer flooding at her home, and we recognise just how distressing this can be. ""Due to complexities surrounding the clean up at the front of the property, further discussions were needed. ""A plan has now been put in place on how best to approach this work."" Mrs Talbot said: ""It's been extremely upsetting. ""We can't go elsewhere for our water and they can do as they please. ""They have us over a barrel. They should be reimbursing us.

60969,Farmers say NI pollution proposals 'out of touch',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4z6wq3l3xo,"Farmers have said plans to reduce water pollution as a result of agricultural activity are ""out of touch"" with the reality of agriculture. Northern Ireland's long-overdue Nutrients Action Programme (NAP) for 2026-29 has been published for consultation. Many of the proposals are linked to the Lough Neagh Action Plan. Making low emission slurry spreading equipment (LESSE) mandatory and placing restrictions on the use of phosphorus fertiliser are among recommended revisions. President of the Ulster Farmers' Union, William Irvine, said it was ""deeply concerning"" the proposals from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) ""lean heavily"" towards enforcement and regulation rather than education, incentives or collaboration with farmers. ""Farmers are not shying away from their responsibilities,"" he said. ""For the last 20 years, since NAP was first introduced, we have been implementing practices to improve water quality. ""We fully recognise the need to protect and improve water quality, but it must be done in a way that's balanced, fair and grounded in the day-to-day realities of farming in NI. ""The proposals within NAP reflect a clear disconnect with local agriculture and fail to deliver what's truly needed."" Daera said it was ""widely recognised that the intensification of agricultural production has had negative impacts on the environment"". Welcoming the consultation, the Northern Ireland Environment Link (NIEL) - which represents more than120,000 individuals and the management/ownership of 314,000 acres of land - said the NAP was a ""starting point for improving NI's precious freshwater environment"". ""We recognise that delivering these changes will not be easy and acknowledge the challenge that many farmers face in adapting to new restrictions and practices, particularly amid rising costs and a continuously shifting policy and regulation landscape,"" a spokesperson said. ""That's why we're calling for a strong programme of advice, investment and long-term support to enable a just and workable transition."" Daera Minister Andrew Muir said action was needed to improve water quality and meet legal obligations. ""This is why it is essential to review NAP and consider additional measures to reduce the overall phosphorus surplus in our agricultural system,"" he said. ""The main additional measures include further restrictions on use of chemical phosphorus fertiliser and a farm phosphorus balance limit for more intensive farms."" He added that while 62% of the nutrient load in waterways could be traced back to to agriculture, other sources such as wastewater treatment and septic tank seepages also play a role. His department also wants to ""enhance"" the enforcement powers available to it, to apply fixed or variable monetary penalties for breaches of the NAP. Speaking onBBC's The View, Muir said he recognised that the measures proposed in the NAP are ""challenging"" and the consultation is ""very complex"". ""Ultimately we do need to change so we can improve our waterways and I don't want to consign Lough Neagh to the scenes we've seen in recent years,"" Muir said. He added that since NI Water was established in 2007 they have had a ""permission to pollute"". He added that he was ""fed up"" with thelack of investment in wastewater infrastructure, and that the Infrastructure Minister Liz Kimmins ""needs to get her head out of the sand and needs to turn the situation around"". ""What I am being left with as the minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs is the job of cleaning up the sewage that NI Water are pumping into our waterways."" On Friday, the minister announced that the consultation would be extended to 12 weeks and will now close on 24 July. ""I recognise that the proposals in the revised NAP have a level of complexity because of the detailed science and evidence underpinning them,"" he said. ""Therefore, having listened to the concerns from farmers and industry about the need for more time to consider the consultation proposals, I am extending the consultation period by four weeks."" Muir said the extension is an ""important opportunity"" for people to respond or offer alternative proposals, and stressed that no final decisions have yet been made. Intensive farms – mostly dairy and some beef farms - can be granted a derogation for using slurry on their land, allowing them to apply up to 250kg nitrogen per hectare per year from grazing livestock manures, rather than 170kg. The number of farms that currently have a derogation is 427. The lower limit for nitrogen would be reduced to 150kg/N/ha/year, putting another 3,100 farms in the category. In total, the consultation document said, these farms account for 17% of all farms, yet produce some 50% of total manure nitrogen. They will also represent a significant proportion of surplus phosphorus because of their greater reliance on feed inputs. These farms would also be subject to a Phosphorus Balance Limit of 10kg/ha/year in 2027, reducing to 8kg in 2029. Other schemes seeking ways of better using slurry and the nutrients it contains include the sustainable use of livestock slurry and using slurry to generate biogas.

The company's pre-tax profits more than doubled to £355m for the year ending 31 March 2025 before a32% hike in bills was introducedto fund £13.7bn in pipe and sewer upgrades. The company has been accused ofillegally pumping raw sewage into Lake Windermerein recent years. United Utilities said it had delivered ""another strong set of results"" and it pointed to the company cutting sewage spills per storm overflow by a quarter last year. The water firm's biggest annual rise came in April this year whenbills surged by an average of £86 for a typical household. More than seven million United Utilities customers living in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cumbria, most of Cheshire and parts of Derbyshire are to see bills rise by an average of 32% over the next five years. The company said it planned to increase its dividend payout to investors by 4.2%. Chief executive Louise Beardmore said: ""We have delivered another strong set of results for customers, communities and the environment in the North West."" United Utilities was recently accused of failing to report more than 100 million litres of untreated sewage that it illegally dumped into Windermere over a three-year period. Ms Beardmore told MPs in February that the firm's record on spills and flooding ""isn't good enough"". She took home a pay packet of £1.4m last year, made up of a base salary valued at £690,000, plus benefits, bonuses and long-term share awards. The UK's privatised water companies have faced growing public outrage over the extent of pollution, rising bills, high dividends and executive pay and bonuses. The results come after a survey revealed households' trust in water companies had fallen to a new low.

216025,What is happening with Flamingo Land at Loch Lomond?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c19d8kvd0m8o,"A proposed resort on the shores of Loch Lomond featuring a waterpark and monorail is set to be approved by the Scottish government, overturning the decision of the national park authority. The project wasinitially rejected last yearby Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park authority, who said it did not comply with environmental and nature conservation policies. The proposal is by theme park operator Flamingo Land. It hopes to build the £40m Lomond Banks resort, which features a monorail, waterpark, hotel and restaurants. Flamingo Land is a theme park and zoo in Yorkshire that has operated since the 1950s. The name comes from a colony of the brightly coloured birds that were among the first animals on the site at Kirby Misperton. In 2018 the company behind the park - Flamingo Land Limited - submitted proposals for a tourist development at Loch Lomond, including a hotel, craft brewery and leisure centre. The plan was met with strong opposition, with an online petition against it gathering more than 55,000 signatures. In September 2019 the company withdrew its original plans, but returned in 2020 with an updated £40m ($50m) proposal featuring a water park, monorail, swimming pool, hotel and restaurants. Throughout the process Flamingo Land has insisted that the development would not be a theme park, and planning papers state that it would be a ""a major step away"" from their other resorts. More than 174,000 people signed the petition against the new proposal. The original plans were dubbed ""the most unpopular planning application in Scottish history"" by Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens MSP, and the revised proposal has proved just as controversial. Concerns have focused on whether the development would distort public green space in one of Scotland's most scenic areas. In April 2024, Lynne Somerville, the chairwoman of Balloch and Haldane Community Council, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that the plans would ""dominate the whole west side of Balloch"" and be a ""living hell"" for people living locally. However, it is not just locals who are concerned, as evidenced by the number of letters sent to the council protesting against it. Others have raised fears that the vista of Loch Lomond would be affected - damaging both a stunning view and a tourist hotspot. Additional traffic in the area is another concern. Flamingo Land estimated an additional 253 cars would be on the road during rush hour times, from 17:30 until 18:30. The original proposals were unanimously objected to by West Dunbartonshire Council, but it did not oppose the proposal the second time around. Tthe park authority is responsible for planning - not the council - but the local authority's change of heart was still greeted furiously by protesters. Flamingo Land has also said the new proposal would feature visitor accommodation and walkways sympathetic to the local environment, and that public access would be maintained throughout the site. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency requested that lodges were removed from part of the site designated as a flood plain and questioned whether proposals to mitigate the risk of floods were ""technically feasible."" Flamingo Land stated in its plans that part of the site was exempt from the flood plain concern due to it having been in previous use as a railway line until the 1980s. Flamingo Land and Lomond Banks believe there would be considerable benefits for the local community, starting with creating around 200 jobs. They have stated that they would use local businesses throughout the construction of the development, estimated to raise £3m for the local economy. The company has made their promises to the area legally binding in a unilateral voluntary undertaking called ""the Lomond Promise."" Improvements to transport in the Loch Lomond area would also be planned, upgrading the congested Stoneymollan roundabout. The planning papers lodged with the park authority state that the Ballochloan roundabout should be reprofiled as well, and that the overall development would become a ""focal point"" for Balloch. The same papers praise the possible monorail in particular. The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority board decided to reject the proposals in September. It cited the concerns over flood risks and the impact on the surrounding environment. The developers said they were disappointed by the decision, but remained committed to the project and would appeal it. The Scottish government planning reporter has sincesignalled his intention to give planning permissionfor the development, overturning the decision of the national park authority. He said the project did not conflict with the local development plan for the area, or the rules set out in the government's national planning framework. The site could operate safely despite being within a flood risk area, he said, and there could be ""locally significant"" benefits in terms of jobs and a boost to the economy. Full planning permission would only be granted if Flamingo Land and the park authority came to a legal agreement. There are 26 weeks for this agreement to be reached - and if it is not, the Scottish government planning reporter will reconsider whether to approve or reject the application. Dr Heather Reid, convener of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park authority board, said the board would now take time to consider the implications of the report. She added: ""We stand by the reasons for the board's unanimous decision to refuse this planning application and it is deeply disappointing that the reporter has taken a different view."" The Balloch and Haldane Community Council said it would fight the decision as it ""contradicts the expressed will of the community"". Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer called the decision an ""anti-democratic outrage"" and said his party was ""urgently considering our options for continuing this fight"".

448776,Yorkshire Dales village shaken by earthquake,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge3ywnxxro,"Residents of a North Yorkshire village have said they were left shaken in their beds by an early morning earthquake. The 2.5-magnitude quake was recorded just after 01:30 BST on Friday to the south west of Litton in the Yorkshire Dales, and it had a depth of 2.5 miles (4km), according to the British Geological Survey (BGS). Earthquakes below a magnitude of 2.5 can sometimes only be picked up with monitoring equipment, but the quake in the Dales was reportedly felt by a number of people in the village and surrounding area. Sandra Lund, from Litton, said it was the ""weirdest experience"" she and her husband had ever had. ""There was a huge bang, it sounded like an explosion,"" she said. ""My husband is actually deaf and he still heard it - that's how loud it was. ""We were looking for smoke, we were dumbfounded. Then everything was just still."" Mrs Lund said neither of them felt anything else afterwards, but she was left unable to sleep as she was ""convinced something had blown up"". Meanwhile, Debbie Roe said she was woken by the sound of two loud bangs which she first thought was ""my cats jumping off the bed"". ""But they were probably the bangs other people heard, and then there was a low rumbling for maybe 10 seconds,"" she explained. Another local resident told the BBC she and her husband experienced ""a loud rumbling noise and the ground shaking"". However, she added that ""it didn't last long at all"". For heavier sleepers, however, online chatter on Friday morning was the first they had heard of any seismic activity in the area. Councillor Richard Foster said he ""didn't hear anything, I slept right through"". Davie Galloway, BGS seismologist, said the organisation received reports that the quake had sounded like ""a large truck coming up the lane"". ""Each year, between 200 and 300 earthquakes are detected and located in the UK by the BGS,"" he said. ""Between 20 to 30 earthquakes are felt by people each year and a few hundred smaller ones are only recorded by sensitive instruments, like the Litton earthquake this morning."" He said that although the Yorkshire Dales are distant from the nearest plate boundary, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, earthquakes could occur as forces acting on tectonic plates were relieved by movement on pre-existing fault planes. ""While UK earthquakes tend to be relatively small, no one can be complacent and the BGS keeps a database for use in seismic assessment and to provide near-immediate responses to significant events, if and when required,"" Mr Galloway added. The last earthquake recorded in North Yorkshire was at Kilnsey in Wharfedale on 18 March, which had a magnitude of two. On Tuesday, the BGS recorded a 1.2-magnitude earthquake in Cardiff.

821604,Remaining peregrine falcon chick at cathedral dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6p0d74l2o,"The final surviving peregrine chick born in a nest on top of Worcester Cathedral has died. Adult birds Peter and Peggy produced four eggs at the cathedral this spring, with the first hatching on Easter Sunday - buttwo chicks diedlast week and the fourth egg failed to hatch. The remaining chick became sick and died at about 20:30 BST on Thursday, a post on Peregrine Falcons in Worcester confirmed. A 24-hour livestreamof the nest was shut down on Thursday after the bird became ill and started acting lethargically, with its parents stopping feeding it. On Facebook on Friday, Peregrine Falcons in Worcester posted that they had initially thought, before it fell ill, that the last chick had managed to avoid an unknown illness which it said had ""caused the demise of the other two"". ""Cause is unknown [for the last chick] and open to speculation until we receive results back from the lab; as stated this could take some time,"" the post went on to say. ""As feared the chick died around 20:30 last night; it has been recovered and will shortly be sent to the lab, joining its sibling for analysis."" Both adult birds appeared to be fit and healthy and would be closely monitored, they added. Thousands of people have been watching progress in the nest box on the livestream on YouTube, with nearly 500,000 people tuning in from across the world in 2024. The nesting pair, also known as Mr and Mrs P, have had three successful years producing and fledging four healthy chicks from 2022 at the cathedral.

1004370,Water centre gets £11m refurb for cleaner rivers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clygv3ygpexo,"A water recycling centre has undergone a multi-million pound refurbishment to better filter chemicals from sewage water. The £11 million project carried out by Wessex Water at Langport over the past 18 months is meant to improve the water quality of the River Parrett and other Somerset waterways. Project manager Victoria Plummer said: ""Chemicals like phosphorus can cause large growths of algae in waterways, damaging plants and animals in those areas by depleting the amount of oxygen in the water."" In the last few years, more than £40 million of similar work to improve treatment methods has been completed or got started across Somerset. This includes work on sites near Martock, Crewkerne and Merriott, all close to the River Parrett. In nearby Somerton, more than £5 million was spent to remove chemicals and enhance the water recycling centre to protect the nearby River Cary. Further north, a £5 million Wessex Water project to build an integrated constructed wetland to naturally remove nutrients is expected to get under way near Shapwick next summer. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Ofwat's final determination of Wessex Water's 2025-30 business plan, which has outlined further action to tackle nutrients in the region's waterways. If fully accepted by the CMA, the plans include investing £820 million in river and coastal water quality by upgrading treatment sites and removing 1,550 tonnes of nutrients from waterways.

129382,At least 25 dead after tornadoes sweep through US Midwest,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nw7v5ykyo,"At least 25 people are reported to have died and dozens are injured after tornadoes tore through parts of two US states. Officials in Kentucky said there had been 18 deaths while seven people were killed in Missouri, including five in the city of St Louis. The Kentucky tornado struck Laurel County in the south-east of the state in the early hours of Saturday. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise. Missouri officials said 5,000 buildings had been damaged, roofs destroyed and power lines downed due to the tornado. About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power as of Saturday afternoon. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said in an update on Saturday that at least 38 people were reported injured in her area, largely from collapsed buildings and toppled trees. Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. ""The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,"" said Laurel County Sheriff John Root in a post on social media. National Weather Service radar suggested the tornado touched down in Missouri shortly after 14:30 local time in the west of the city close to Forest Park - home to St Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 Olympic Games. St Louis Fire Department said three people had to be rescued after part of the nearby Centennial Christian Church collapsed. One of those people died. A curfew was imposed from 21:00 to 06:00 local time in the two areas where most of the damage took place, to prevent injuries from debris and reduce the potential for looting. St Louis mayor Spencer said: ""The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous. ""We're going to have a lot of work to do in the coming days. There is no doubt there, but tonight we are focused on saving lives and keeping people safe and allowing our community to grieve."" The US National Weather Service said tornadoes also hit neighbouring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast. On Saturday, it warned of few tornadoes that could hit northern Texas over the weekend as a result of strong to severe storms in the area. The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as ""Tornado Alley"", where tornadoes are most frequent. They typically occur in the months of May and June, though they could strike during other times of the year. Kentucky has seen an average of five tornadoes each May since the year 2000, while Missouri has seen an average of 16. Are you in the area?Please get in touchbut only if it is safe to do so.

The flooring, believed to have been once trodden on by the playwright and actor, was discovered at St George's Guildhall in King's Lynn, Norfolk, in 2023. A conservation project has worked on exposing the wooden floorboards and other areas of the venue. Tim FitzHigham, creative director of the theatre, said: ""The information that's coming out of that floor is kind of like the dry equivalent of theMary Rose; that's how important this discovery is."" The theatre's first recorded performances took place in 1445, long beforeShakespeare's birthin 1564. During 1592-1593 London's theatres were closed because of an outbreak of plague and Shakespeare and his company of actors were on tour in King's Lynn. Thetheatre claims documents showThe Bard acted there in 1592 or 1593. Last yeara doorway, that may once have led to the Bard's dressing room, was also discovered at the King Street venue. Performances were moved to another building on-site in February to start lifting layers of the floor. Mr FitzHigham said the area of floor was ""larger than a tennis court and it's all 1419 beams all around you"". ""Having the whole floor exposed gives us a massive amount of information about the use of the venue over the last 600 years,"" he added. During the conservation project, there has been early evidence of playgoers eating food, drinking, and smoking at the venue. ""We've literally found the food. We found all this stuff down the cracks of the floorboards,"" Mr FitzHigham said. ""We've got loads of nutshells, oyster shells, bits of pipe, broken wine bottles and chicken bones.""

363605,Anti-sewage campaigners stage 'paddle out protest',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2491rlr49do,"Water quality campaigners have staged a ""paddle out protest"" on Bristol Harbour to demand an overhaul of the water industry to cut sewage spills. Organised by environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, protestors gathered at Baltic Wharf with signs reading ""species not faeces"" and ""waste in the water - otterly disgusting"". It was one of more than 40 similar protests around the UK calling for an end to raw sewage discharge into waterways, and clearer monitoring and transparency of spills. Wessex Water said it was spending £3m a month to reduce the use of storm overflows, which it said discharged ""mostly rainwater or groundwater"" and were used ""to protect properties from flooding"". One protestor said she just wanted to be able to swim in the waters around Bristol ""without thinking I'm going to get ill"". Anna Steele-Perkins told BBC Bristol: ""It's actually quite an anxious experience to swim around Bristol -I've got to keep my head above water and I've got a lot of friends who have got quite ill from doing it."" She added that she monitors sewage spills on the SAS app, but added: ""I don't want to have to do that, I just want to be able to swim."" SAS Bristol member Karlie Evans said: ""I'm a huge water user. I'm a rower, I paddle board, I surf, I swim. I just want to be able to use the water safely."" The protest coincides with the start of the official bathing season in England and Wales, which runs from 15 May to 30 September. Water companies spilled raw sewage for a record 3.61m hours into sea and rivers in England in 2024, according to data from the Environment Agency. Giles Bristow, chief executive at Surfers Against Sewage said: ""Another year, another summer of swimming and surfing in sewage while our shameless water companies laugh all the way to the bank."" He added: ""Our failing water industry has been trumpeting billions in investment to clean up their act, but we know that these fat cat bosses can't be trusted to keep their promises."" Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Steve Reed, said: ""I share the public's anger about the appalling state our waterways have been left in after years of neglect."" He added: ""The landmark Water Act is now law, meaning polluting water bosses face up to two years in prison and undeserved multi-million-pound bonuses will be banned."" An Environment Agency spokesperson said: ""Last year, nearly 92% of bathing waters met minimum standards, but we all want to see better bathing water quality. ""That's why we welcome the opportunity to improve their management through the incoming reforms and the re-opening of new site applications."" The water companies serving the region, Thames Water and Wessex Water, have been approached for comment. A Thames Water spokesperson said the company will investing a record amount over the next five years to increase treatment capacity, reduce the number of discharges caused by storms and also tackle nutrient pollution. The spokesperson said: ""We are committed to seeing waterways thrive, but we can't do it alone. ""Farming, industry, road runoff, wildlife and increasingly extreme weather also play a role in river health."" They added: ""We understand that all untreated discharges are unacceptable, even when they are permitted, the sewage system was historically designed to prevent sewage backing up into people's homes. ""Transparency is at the heart of what we do, and we were the first water company to publish a real time data map on our website, before it became legal requirement to do so."" A Wessex Water spokesperson said: ""Storm overflows operate to protect properties from flooding and discharge mostly rainwater or groundwater, but we agree they are outdated and we're spending £3m every month on schemes to reduce how often this happens in our region. ""Our investment will massively increase in the coming years and must be supported by environmental policymaking that promotes better rainwater management at source.""

606409,Solar farm frustrated by 'zombie project' delays,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwywj070jpwo,"Work on a large solar farm that should have started last summer has still not begun because of delays getting it connected to the grid, a developer has said. Plans for the JAFA farm development near Swaffham in Norfolk were approved in February 2023 and it was hoped it would become operational this year. Last month, energy regulator Ofgem backed reforms to remove ""zombie projects"" from the connections queue and make it quicker for viable proposals to get hooked up to the power grid. The firm behind JAFA, Low Carbon, said it welcomed the reforms but the wait had been ""frustrating"". When the project was put before planners at Breckland District Council, it would have been one of the biggest solar farms in the country. Covering 233 acres (94 hectares), it was said it could generate enough power for 16,500 homes a year. That has been dwarfed by more recent proposals for ""megafarms"" in Norfolk, some as large as 5,000 acres (1,618 hectares). Nonetheless, there was some controversy around JAFA, with nearby Great Dunham Parish Council ""totally opposed"" to it because of the loss of good quality farmland and the visual impact on the area. But Little Dunham Parish Council gave its support to the plan, voted through by councillors on the basis that Breckland needed more low-carbon energy. Work on the site was due to start last summer, but has yet to begin as there is currently no way of connecting it to the grid. ""It is really frustrating,"" said Ed Birkett, Low Carbon's new projects director. ""There's a real issue across the industry, where there are so many projects in the grid connections queue that are waiting to connect. It's leading to really long delays - up to 10 or 12 years in some cases."" The systemhas been cloggedwith so-called ""zombie projects"" – proposals that show little sign of progressing but are in the queue for a connection. Ofgem has nowapproved reforms to the systemthat will give priority to viable developments. Asher Minns, of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, welcomed the reforms but warned there was ""a massive, massive backlog of projects"" that had been stalled across the country. ""We are so far behind on generating the green renewable energy that we need for energy security – we are decades behind where we should be,"" he said. Mr Birkett said he hoped his company could now get JAFA built and connected in ""the next one to two years"".

958000,Hydro marks 10 years of green electricity,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd29jpr2q5o,"It is 10 years since Osney Lock Hydro - the first community-owned hydro to be built on the Thames – started generating electricity. It produces an average of 165MWh of electricity each year, enough to power 60 homes. Solar panels on the roof contribute another 8MWh. The facility in Oxford is managed by volunteers with a contractor providing technical support. Most of the £690,000 it cost to build the hydro was raised from members of the local community through a series of share offers. Hydropower uses the power of flowing water, such as rivers and streams, to turn turbines, which in turn power generators. All the electricity generated at the Oxford site is consumed by the Environment Agency's Osney depot and the community on Osney Island. The facility is open to the public Friday to Sunday and there are information boards and a digital display explaining how the hydro works. Barbara Hammond, one of the founding directors, said: ""The project was initially conceived in 2001 and it's been an incredible journey with amazing contributions from so many people. ""We believe passionately in the role community energy can play in helping reach net zero."" A fish pass, built as part of the project, has allowed fish to move up and down the river at Osney for the first time in 200 years. The garden is managed with wildlife in mind, with a hedge of native UK species, a wild meadow and a flower border which is a feast for bees. Architect David Hammond, a driving force in the original project, designed the powerhouse and garden area. He died in 2023 and is commemorated at the site by an oak bench. Osney Lock Hydro is owned by West Oxford Community Renewables (WOCoRe), a registered society, run for the benefit of the community. In addition to the hydro, WOCoRe operates solar PV arrays on the King's Centre, an Aldi supermarket and Matthew Arnold School. These installations were funded, like the hydro, through community share offers. Money generated from the society's assets is used to promote carbon cutting measures in the local community and to fund nature recovery projects. The society has a board of volunteer directors elected by the shareholders. As a registered society, WOCoRe exists for the benefit of the community. It delivers those benefits through generating clean energy, showcasing the potential of community energy, supporting local wildlife, and through grants to local community organisations.

The government has given the money to Hemiko via its Green Heat Network Fund, which invests in innovative heating projects to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency. The heat network scheme in Lincoln will involve distributing waste heat from a data centre, using air source heat pumps to warm water that will run through underground pipes to customers. A Hemiko spokesperson said the project would create 40 local jobs over the first five years of the network being built, with construction expected to begin in spring 2026 if plans are approved. Minister for Energy Consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh said: ""Heat networks will play an important role in our mission for clean power by 2030, helping us to achieve energy independence and lower bills.""

The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found ""under our noses"", said Andrew Fusek Peters. ""I wanted to celebrate the everyday stories and reveal the beauty of our birds, mammals and insects that live alongside us,"" the Shropshire photographer added. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book. The majority of the photographs were taken in his ""modest"" garden, and local village of Lydbury. ""You don't have to travel to nature reserves or mountains,"" he said. ""I sometimes get snobbery from the big photographers who go to Africa and do the lions and tigers, or Greenland for the Polar bears,"" he explained. ""And they think I'm somehow inferior because I do blue tits in the garden."" But, he added, capturing rare images such as a hare feeding her leveret on someone's back lawn was ""just amazing"". ""At the time I took it, that had been photographed maybe less than 10 times in the world,"" he said. ""It was sheer gold on my memory card."" He had also travelled to other parts of the UK in order to capture other ""extraordinary moments,"" including a fox family playing in Clapham, south London, and a pair of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight. Mr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018,perfecting a techniqueto ""make time stop"" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight.

""This winter I got a woodpecker and a nuthatch"" he said, adding the images were ""extraordinary"". ""Everyone's going to accuse me of using AI, but it's not - it's actually scientific."" He added he was ""one of the few in the world"" to have taken such images. ""I just seem to have this blessed luck when I concentrate on what's out of the kitchen window."" The book was also a ""rallying cry"" to transform ""over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens,"" he said. ""These places are important, I think they really are,"" he added. ""As we know with climate change and with what's happening with habitat a lot of species are really suffering, and that includes our garden visitors so it's important to showcase them. ""They are just as important as all the wonderful creatures of the jungle and the desert,"" he added.

115067,Water testing under way as bathing season begins,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kq5lepq5lo,"The Environment Agency has begun testing water quality across the South East following the start of the official bathing season. Speaking to the BBC in Hythe, Kent, Lindsay Faulkner of the Environment Agency said they were looking for bacteria, such as E.coli, that could ""make people ill"". It comes as the government body was advising against bathing in Bognor Regis, Worthing and Bexhill in Sussex, as well as Littlestone, Dymchurch and Deal in Kent due to poor water quality on Friday. However, the majority of designated bathing zones were classified by the Environment Agency as having good or excellent water quality. Ms Faulkner said there were ""multiple reasons"" why water bacteria levels might be high, such as human and animal sewage or agricultural run-off. ""We're working with local authorities, water companies and community groups to help identify sources of pollution and put a stop to them,"" she added. Water companies spilt raw sewage for arecord time of 3.61 million hoursinto seas and rivers in England in 2024, according to Environment Agency data. Southern Water, a major water supplier in the region, along with South East Water and Thames Water, said protecting and enhancing water quality was ""so important"" to the company. ""Over the last 30 years, the quality of our bathing waters has risen from only 28% meeting public health standards to 84% now rated as 'good' or 'excellent',"" it said. The water company added it would spend £1bn a year on environmental improvement over the next five years. Ms Faulkner said in some bathing zones sources of pollution were ""really easy"" to spot as it could be one pipe causing a problem. ""But the situation here [in the Dymchurch area of Kent] is that there are multiple sources,"" she added. ""It appears to be diffuse pollution."" The bathing season officially started on 15 May and will run until the end of September.

1066559,'Quite a surprise' to spot 4ft shark swimming in river,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23m4l3rjj3o,"A man has said he ""couldn't believe"" what he was seeing when he came across a shark swimming in an east Belfast river. Thomas Davidson was cycling through Victoria Park on Tuesday evening when he spotted a 4ft-long starry smooth-hound shark in the Connswater River, where the waterway meets Belfast Lough. The species of shark has been seen in other urban areas such as theRiver Thamesand theRiver Mersey estuary. Dr Patrick Collins, a marine biologist at Queen's University, said while ""it's not something you see everyday, it's not something super unusual either"". ""In the past I would occasionally have seen several 2-3lb mullet follow the tide in, but on this occasion I saw a much larger shape in the water adjacent to Airport Road,"" Mr Davidson told BBC News NI. He said this shape was ""too big to be a mullet"", so he stopped to take a closer look. ""A dorsal fin slowly broke the surface revealing that familiar profile that looked like a shark,"" he said. ""I quickly took out my phone and started to video this slow-moving fish as it meandered left and right up and downstream, getting mobbed by a few gulls. ""I couldn't believe what I was watching."" The shark continued swimming in this section of river for about 30 minutes before moving upstream into a shadow area and Mr Davidson lost sight of it. ""I felt very lucky to witness such a lengthy sighting and was left curious as to how far upstream it might go,"" he said. TheConnswater Riverrises in the Castlereagh hills and runs northwards through east Belfast, getting wider until it reaches the sea at Belfast Lough. The river route includes the Connswater Greenway walking route and flows past CS Lewis Square and Connswater Shopping Centre. Mr Davidson said it was ""quite a surprise"" and he will ""continue to look out for it and others in the future"". This type of shark mainly eat crabs and small crustaceans, marine biologist Dr Patrick Collins said. The section of the river in Victoria Park probably contained crabs, and so this shark spotted by Mr Davidson was ""probably just having its lunch"", he explained. He said it is ""not very common to find smooth-hounds in cities, but they have been recorded in the last few years"". ""It's a little bit unusual if you're walking your dog to find one that close to the city, and that easy to see, but they're not a rare animal,"" Dr Collins continued. ""They're found fairly commonly across the UK and Ireland. It's not an unusual occurrence to have them close to an urban centre because there's sea water there. ""It's a bit like seeing a deer in farmland."" He added thatthis type of sharkposes no risk to the public. ""Because of movies like Jaws and some other strange public perceptions coming from that, there's this idea that all sharks are dangerous animals - they're a type of fish. ""These animals pose absolutely no threat to us whatsoever."" Julie Ann McIlwaine admitted killing James Joseph Crossley but denied his murder.

259995,"'Our paddleboards come out brown, it's disgusting'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70nwrjzn9do,"Paddle-boarders, punters and swimmers have held protests at rivers and beaches across the East of England to call for action against sewage pollution. ""When you take the paddle boards out of the water at the end of the day, they're just brown and it's disgusting,"" said Mel Sambells at the event on Saturday in Whitlingham Broad, Norfolk. Demonstrations organised bySurfers Against Sewagewere also held on same day on the River Cam in Cambridge, the River Deben in Suffolk, and beaches in Essex. Anglian Water apologised after it recorded nearly 44,000 sewage discharges across the region in 2024 and said it was spending £1bn on overflow and spillage problems. ""This is our playground. We're paddle boarders and swimmers, and we're fed up of it because people have got sick after swimming,"" said Darren, who came up with the idea of ""Pirates against Poo"". ""The water companies put in profit before pollution, which is affecting wildlife and the environment. ""It's not good, and it needs to stop. Is £1bn enough? Is it too little too late? It can't happen tomorrow, it has to happen today,"" he told the BBC. Jacky Honor added: ""They say things are changing, but we need to make sure that's going to happen, so we can't just step back and be quiet. We need to keep our presence out there."" Fellow protester Chris Williams said he had noticed ""pollution incidents"" since settling in Norfolk and doing water sports, including in the River Wensum and Bure. ""After a while I understood it was a major problem and we had to do something to get people's attention. ""We're all here in fancy dress, but we're making a stand against the sewage incidents and pollution, and trying to hold these water companies to account. ""Something needs to be done soon,"" he said. Anglian Water said it was spending £11bn overall to improve its performance, and blamed a large number of storm spills in recent years on extreme weather. Elsewhere in Essex, a protest was held at Jubilee Beach in Southend, which Surfers Against Sewage said ""has one of the worst-hit bathing waters"". It said Anglian Water had promised to cut sewage by 75% but in fact, it increased by 30% in 2024. ""All of these reasons, combined with the loss of two Blue Flags in two years, demonstrates to us the environmental degradation, potential risk to public health and the need for massive change,"" the campaign group said. AnAnglian Waterspokesperson said bathing water quality was ""complicated"" and could ""be affected by many different factors"". ""We know our customers will be disappointed to see an increase in our storm overflow data this year. ""This is largely reflective of the extreme weather and persistent flooding we saw across our region in the first part of 2024 which accounted for nearly 50% of our spills. ""We know our assets need to be resilient to changing weather patterns. We also understand the strength of feeling around storm spills, and having apologised, we have promised transformational action – because we know our climate is going to keep changing, so we have to find better ways of dealing with extreme rainfall.

1108105,"Foot-and-mouth outbreak 'when, not if' - port boss",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0dr5lk2eno,"A councillor responsible for health at the Port of Dover has warned the return of foot-and-mouth disease to the UK is inevitable, unless government funding improves. Jamie Pout, of Dover District Council, said the health authority was ""barely scratching the surface"" when it came to suitable checks at the Kent port. He added it was ""a matter of time"" until foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever arrived in the country. The port has been approached for comment, while the government said it would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect British farmers from disease. The government added that it had significantly increased seizures of illegal meat products, restricted animal products from EU countries with outbreaks, and banned personal meat and dairy imports for EU travellers. It said it was also investing more than £200m in a new National Biosecurity Centre. It comes after recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia. Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly infectious virus that causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. It poses no risk to humans and there are currently no cases in the UK. Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could potentially be contaminated. Labour MP Josh Newbury, who sits on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA), said last week that he saw health inspections at the port being done under ""rusty canopies, with nesting pigeons [in buildings] that had no walls"". Facilities had ""no ability to wash down"" and lacked personal protection equipment other than gloves, he added. Roy Glover, a third-generation livestock farmer and butcher from Hartley Bottom Farm, near Dartford, called the UK's last foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001 ""devastating"" for local farmers. He said it put ""stress"" on his family farm and business. ""It was terrible. I remember being unable to sleep worrying that our farm could be next,"" he said. ""You'd see other farms go down, and you'd spend your time thinking that it could be you next."" Mr Glover urged the government to take foot-and-mouth disease seriously. ""More needs to be done.

168714,Hundreds turn out for paddle out sewage protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c753716r66go,"Hundreds of swimmers, surfers and paddleboarders have taken to the sea in Cornwall and Devon as part of an annual protest against an ""ongoing sewage scandal"". The nationwide Paddle Out Protest, hosted by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS), took place across 42 bathing sites across the UK on Saturday, including Gylly Beach in Falmouth, as well as Porthmeor and Seaton in Cornwall; and Exmouth, Croyde and Plymouth Hoe in Devon. The charity said water users in the south-west of England were paddling out ""against South West Water's shocking record of sewage pollution"". South West Water said its focus had been to reduce spills at beaches in the bathing season by 20% in the last five years. SAS CEO Giles Bristow, who attended the protest in Falmouth, said the organisation was holding water companies to account. He said: ""We want this ocean to be clean, we want to be able to swim and surf in places like this and just enjoy it without the risk of getting sick; and we want to stop this destruction of our beautiful and precious environment. ""We want people to enjoy it, we want people to go in informed and make sure they're safe, but, ultimately, we've got to clean up these, quite frankly, dirty waters. ""Yes, they're telling us they're investing. The question is can we trust them to do this. So we're all here, we're watching and we're holding them to account."" South West Water said it ""fully respected"" the rights of those who wish to protest peacefully. A spokesperson said: ""We were one of only five companies in the industry to reduce spills compared to 2023. ""Our focus has been to reduce spills at beaches in the bathing season by 20% in the last five years as we continue to focus on what our customers care about. ""We have also been focused on the highest-spilling sites from 2023 and have already removed three-quarters of the top 20 sites.

945837,Ancient Indian skeleton gets a museum home six years after excavation,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20nk27lng3o,"A 1,000 year-old human skeleton which was buried sitting cross-legged in India has been moved to a museum six years after it was excavated. The BBC had reportedearlier this monththat the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling. On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed. Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed. Mahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with ""utmost care"" and under the supervision of several experts. He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum. It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier. ""It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,"" Mr Surela said. Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved. Ambekar had earlier told the BBC that the skeleton was a rare discovery as similar remains had been found at only three other sites in India. But as officials argued over who should take charge of the skeleton, it remained in a make-shift tent close to the excavation site, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Experts say that the skeleton likely belongs to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE. The skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that aided preservation. Mr Ambekar said that the remains could shed light on the phenomenon of ""samadhi burials"" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried rather than cremated.

922514,Funding cuts leave national park 'near cliff edge',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyk9xyevgo,"A national park is ""close to a cliff edge"", facing cuts to education, outreach and ranger services after a reduction in its government funding, according to its boss. The chief executive of the Northumberland National Park Authority (NNPA) Tony Gates said a cut of about 8% in its revenue grant for this year comes on top of a long-term financial squeeze. ""I'm really struggling to see how we can remove £350,000 from our budget next year without cutting back some really critical services,"" Mr Gates said. The government said it had given England's 10 national parks a £15m capital uplift, calling them a ""source of national pride"". But Mr Gates said funding for the national park had fallen sharply in real terms over 15 years, forcing the closure of visitor centres and the shrinking of its team of rangers. ""We're facing the single largest cut in our revenue budget that we've had in our history,"" Mr Gates said. ""At a time when we face a nature crisis, a climate crisis and a health and wellbeing crisis for our people, the impact is likely that we're reducing the number of programmes in those areas rather than expanding them."" Steve Miller, who owns a campsite at Melkridge, said the park was vital for local tourism. He said most of his customers come to use the facilities and enjoy the countryside. ""If the National Park didn't exist it would definitely impact the amount of visitors coming,"" Mr Miller said. Mr Gates said Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs capital investment was ""very welcome"", but it still left the park struggling to cover it running costs. ""It helps pay for facilities,"" he said. ""But I need to have a team in place to identify what those capital investments are... to look after them and maintain them.""

Whipsnade Zoo's section manager of birds, Tim Savage, said contributing to the European breeding programme was ""vital"" He explained: ""As wild populations have sadly declined by more than 57% in the last 27 years, contributing to the European breeding programme to create a healthy and genetically diverse backup population in conservation zoos is vital.

777572,How dangerous dust is putting farm workers' lives at risk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c071g2mxl9yo,"The risks of working with animals and machinery on farms are well known, but agricultural workers are being reminded of another danger that is part of their everyday work. The Health and Safety Executive (HSENI) have teamed up with other agencies to spread awareness of the dangerous of dust particles which can lead to scarring on the lungs atthis year's Balmoral Show. Johnny Tuft, a fourth generation farmer from Ballinderry in County Antrim, described being unable to stop coughing whilst in bed at night. Previously, Mr Tuft said he would convince himself he would be ""wasting"" a doctor's time but now said he will take lung health more seriously in future. More than 300 people a year die from work-related illnesses in Northern Ireland, according to HSENI. Johnny Tuft farms a mixed farm with beef cattle, sheep, arable and poultry units and is often exposed to dust particles. ""We need to bed our livestock whether it be cattle or poultry and there's dust in the bedding,"" he said. ""We grow arable and we feed livestock with our own barley and through the whole cultivation process there's dust. ""When you're in the tractor there's dust, whenever we roll barley that creates a lot of dust and then feeding it too."" Wearing a mask would help reduce exposure but Mr Tuft said he often did not have time to protect himself. ""There's times where the mask isn't beside you or you're under time pressure and it's just too easy to go and do the job without PPE [personal protective equipment],"" he said. ""Then maybe that night you're lying in bed and you can't stop coughing"". Bryan Monson, the deputy chief executive of HSENI, is using the Balmoral Show to help spread the message of lung health to farmers. ""There's nothing like coming to Balmoral to meet people face to face and we can give them some really useful advice, along with our other partners, about how they look after themselves,"" he said. Recent research carried out for the organisation showed how risky farming could be for respiratory health. ""For farmers unfortunately they're exposed to an awful lot of different dusts and chemicals and gases, and those can affect and damage people's lungs, and it's maybe not that well known or understood,"" Mr Monson said. ""So this year, what we're hoping to do is raise awareness of lung health and some of the simple things that people can do to protect themselves."" He said reducing exposure to dust was really important. ""People will immediately think 'I'm putting on a dust mask', and that can be part of the solution,"" he said. ""But as well as that, working in well ventilated areas, working upwind of dusty activities, wetting down dusts before they're brushed or moved around, and possibly buying pelleted forms of feeds and chemicals rather than loose forms. ""All of these can reduce your dust exposure."" Dr Sean Roe, a senior lecturer at Queens University Belfast's medical school, said farmers often dismissed the initial signs of a respiratory issues, which include sniffing, coughing or watery eyes. He said it was better to try to prevent a respiratory issue rather than try to cure it. ""to be working from the point of view of prevention rather than cure"". ""Prevention is really the best way of dealing with it because in the long term, once you start to do permanent damage to the lungs, it's very hard to treat it,"" Dr Roe said. ""If you take in that dust and it stays down it can produce scar tissue in the lungs. ""The problem with scar tissue is - if you've ever had a scar on the back of your hand - you'll notice that the scar tissue isn't as flexible as the skin and it's similar in the lungs that over a long period of time, it leads to what's known as pulmonary fibrosis. ""Pulmonary fibrosis is a situation where the lungs become smaller and stiffer and less elastic and harder to inflate, and that can give rise to one of the problems which is known as chronic farmer's lungs."" Mr Tuft said he would now think more about his respiratory health when he is working. ""I think now that I'm starting to know people that have had health issues, long health issues from farms maybe I need to start taking it a bit more seriously,"" he said. ""I would tend not to go to the doctor unless I'm in pain. I would nearly convince myself I am wasting the doctor's time if it's just a cough, that I'll be fine in the morning. ""But maybe I should be more concerned."" Julie Ann McIlwaine admitted killing James Joseph Crossley but denied his murder.

The University of Wolverhampton law graduate has been awarded the inaugural prize for her novel, And So I Roar, a sequel to her bestselling debut, The Girl with the Louding Voice. And So I Roar delves into the lives of rural women and girls in Nigeria, whose lives are impacted by environmental collapse. Daré, who lives in Benfleet, Essex, said: ""As a Black British-Nigerian woman, receiving this prize is a reminder that we do not need to wait for permission to step into global conversations or to contort our stories to fit a certain lens."" The author won the prestigious £10,000 prize at a ceremony in London on Wednesday evening. Author and judging chair Madeleine Bunting described the novel as: ""A book of real energy and passion, which both horrifies and entertains with a cast of compelling characters, a story of how the climate crisis can provoke social crisis where often women and children are the victims. ""Despite the tragedy, Abi Daré holds faith in the strength of individuals and relationships, and her hopefulness leaves us inspired."" The Climate Prize strives to celebrate the most inspiring novels tackling the climate crisis. On its official website, a spokesperson for the prize said: ""We want to reward and showcase powerful stories that depict the human response to climate change, how it impacts us and how society responds. ""For societies to fully grasp the climate change threat and to embrace its solutions, we need better stories. It's not enough for audiences to know about climate change, they need to see an uncertain future and understand that change is urgent but possible. ""Many of us already see tackling climate as important, but we don't always know how we should respond. Fiction can help us imagine what change can look like."" And So I Roar was one of five books to be shortlisted alongside The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley, Briefly Very Beautiful by Roz Dineen, The Morningside by Téa Obreht and Orbital by Samantha Harvey - whichwon the 2024 Booker Prize. Speaking of Daré's win, David Wedge, the University of Wolverhampton's head of alumni relations, said: ""We are incredibly proud of Abi for winning this groundbreaking award.

47934,MPs call for year-long delay to farm inheritance tax,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv78q0g3jo,"Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned. Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% – half the usual rate – saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget. In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without ""adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment"". The government said its inheritance tax reforms were ""vital"" and its commitment to farmers was ""steadfast"". Efra's report said the tax reforms ""threaten to affect the most vulnerable"" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek ""appropriate professional advice"". National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay ""doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers"". He said the policy remained ""fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed"". The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall. The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme ""affected trust in the government"" and left many farmers ""at risk of becoming unviable"". When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it asanother ""shattering blow"" to farmers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure. But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that ""a restoration of trust is urgently required"". Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively.

Sampling will continue until the end of September, with updates available on theSwimfo website, it said. Samples are tested for harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and intestinal enterococci. The agency said Swimfo also included pollution risk forecasting, which warns people on some days water quality could be temporarily reduced due to factors such as rainfall, wind and high tides. Beaches are classed as excellent, good, sufficient and poor. Any classification from sufficient and above means the water is safe to swim in, said the agency. Beaches such as Perranporth in Cornwall received an excellent grading while only two beaches in Devon and Cornwall, Coastguards Beach on the Erme Estuary and Porthluney, were classed as poor. A poor classification means ""very high standards are not consistently met"", said the agency, which would be ""actively investigating why"".

1043502,MPs call for year-long delay to farm inheritance tax,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv78q0g3jo#comments,"Farm inheritance tax changes should be delayed by a year and alternative schemes that will not harm small family businesses need to be properly considered, a committee of MPs has warned. Government plans to tax inherited agricultural assets worth more than £1m at a rate of 20% – half the usual rate – saw protests across the UK after they were announced in the Autumn Budget. In a report released on Friday, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee said the changes were made without ""adequate consultation, impact assessment or affordability assessment"". The government said its inheritance tax reforms were ""vital"" and its commitment to farmers was ""steadfast"". Efra's report said the tax reforms ""threaten to affect the most vulnerable"" but delaying the implementation of the policy until April 2027 would give those farmers more time to seek ""appropriate professional advice"". National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Tom Bradshaw said a delay ""doesn't take the terrible pressure off older farmers"". He said the policy remained ""fundamentally unfit, destructive, badly constructed and must be changed"". The government says the changes will only affect the wealthiest 500 farms each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) estimate that up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall. The committee also warned that the government's sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) environmental payments scheme ""affected trust in the government"" and left many farmers ""at risk of becoming unviable"". When the SFI scheme, which more than 50,000 farm businesses are signed up to, was closed in March, the NFU described it asanother ""shattering blow"" to farmers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has since announced it will allow SFI applications that were in progress within two months of its closure. But the committee said that lessons should be learned and that ""a restoration of trust is urgently required"". Efra committee chairman Alistair Carmichael said the confidence and wellbeing of farmers had been affected negatively. ""The government, however, seems to be dismissing farmers' concerns and ignoring the strength of feeling evidenced in the months of protests that saw tractors converge on Westminster and up and down the country,"" he added.

305410,Plans to build lithium battery facility rejected,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7ey1qr5jo,"Plans to build a lithium battery storage facility in East Devon have been rejected. Clearstone Energy had asked for permission to build and operate the battery energy storage system (BESS) south of Hazelhurst Raymonds Hill in Axminster. However, planners at East Devon District Council rejected the scheme after a three-and-a-half hour debate which saw residents raise concerns about fire risks and pollution. Despite the developer stating its equipment was 100% safe, examples of BESS fires around the country were highlighted as evidence about why the scheme should be refused. BESS facilities allow energy companies to store electricity generated by renewable sources, such as wind or solar. The Local Democracy Reporting Servicesaid this meant they could provide locations with renewably-generated energy, even when supply from those sources was low because of lack of sunshine or wind. Simon Rothwell, from Clearstone Energy, said proposals such as this one were ""critical"" to increasing energy security, reducing energy costs and slowing the rate of climate change. He said the project would not have ""put the safety of local residents or the water supplies at risk"". Elliot Jones, speaking on behalf of Hawkchurch Action Group, said the application being considered raised ""profound risks to public safety and environmental integrity"". Councillor Sarah Jackson said she had worked at a company that developed products to contain lithium iron battery fires. She said they were ""toxic"" and ""hard to extinguish"". Councillor Paul Hayward said he understood the need for green energy solutions, but felt the application contradicted many of the council's planning policies. He said: ""With power comes responsibility, and so anyone proposing this type of scheme in open countryside needs to provide you with 100% assurance that the benefits outweigh the risk of harm.

789857,Ed Miliband criticises Reform's Net Zero stance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gew0nj285o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband criticised Reform UK's stance on Net Zero as he defended his decision to approve a large solar farm in East Yorkshire. A proposal to build a 3,155 acre (1,277 hectares) site near Howden, despite objections by locals, was given the go-ahead last week. Reform, which recently took control of Lincolnshire County Council as well as winning mayoral elections in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, has campaigned on abandoning the government's target to reach Net Zero by 2050. Miliband said Reform's view was ""wrong"" and added: ""We're going to have a debate with them about it."" Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice, who is the MP for Boston and Skegness, hasdescribed renewable energy as a ""massive con""that raised energy bills and pledged his party would introduce a windfall tax on green energy companies. Miliband added: ""I think people vote in elections for all kinds of reasons, but I'm going to make the case, as will local MPs, for why renewables are about lower bills and they're about good jobs. ""Just a few miles from here we've got the Siemens factory - 1600 people manufacturing wind turbines. What I'd say to those people who've been elected is don't turn your back on those jobs. Don't turn your back on lower bills."" The Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero was visiting the site of a solar farm in Cottingham that provides electricity to Castle Hill Hospital, five days after approving the site in Howden. He said he understood why people have concerns about solar farms and took those on board when making the decision to give it the go-ahead. ""Whenever decisions like that are made, we listen to local people's views,"" he said. ""But we have to make also wider decisions about how we're going to get clean, homegrown power that we control so we can cut people's bills and we know what happens when we're left reliant on fossil fuels."" One local protest group said there was""severe disappointment""that the site was approved. Its developers said it would produce 400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 100,000 homes. Due to its size, the decision to go ahead was made by Miliband as it is classed as national infrastructure. It is one of a number oflarge solar developmentsplanned for East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. He told BBC Look North: ""Every solar panel we put up, every wind turbine we build, every piece of infrastructure we build helps get us off those fossil fuels and give us energy security.""

608961,Two new raven chicks arrive at the Tower of London,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgww2v204o,"Two five-week-old raven chicks, Henry and Poe, have arrived at their new home in the Tower of London. ""Troublemakers"" Henry and Poe will spend the next few weeks in the enclosure before being introduced to the six other ravens there and eventually encouraged to explore their new residence. Henry is named after all of the Henrys who have lived at the 900-year-old palace and Poe is named after the writer Edgar Allan Poe whose works include the poem The Raven. The Tower usually has six ravens at any time and, according to legend, if they ever leave, it is said that both the fortress and the kingdom will fall. The new arrivals were born in April as part of the Tower of London's raven breeding programme and join Jubilee, Harris, Poppy, Georgie, Edgar and Chaos at the fortress. The group of ravens - known as an unkindness or conspiracy - are cared for by the Ravenmaster Barney Chandler and his team. ""It's an honour to be introducing our new raven chicks Henry and Poe to the Tower of London, and I'm absolutely delighted with how they've settled in so far,"" said Mr Chandler. ""The team and I have had a busy couple of weeks looking after these troublemakers, who require a lot of care and attention when they're very young, but now that they're almost fully fledged we're ready to bring them into the fold and let the other ravens take over showing them the ropes."" The corvids are fed a variety of raw meat each day, an egg once a week and blood-soaked biscuits as a special treat. The Tower of London added that the ravens' important duties included  ""posing for photographs and taste-testing packed lunch items"". According to the Tower of London, the legend states that King Charles II was the first to insist that the ravens of the Tower of London be protected. The story is that the King's astronomer John Flamsteed, who had an observatory in the White Tower, complained that the resident ravens were impeding his work and requested their removal. The king was advised that if the ravens left the Tower of London the kingdom would fall - the myth has been kept alive ever since.

Adult birds Peter and Peggy had produced four eggs, with the first hatching on Easter Sunday. However, two chicks died last week, with the fourth failing to hatch. The remaining chick became sick on Thursday, not calling for food and acting lethargically, which the parents noticed and made no attempt to feed - they will not normally feed ill chicks. A post on peregrine falcons in Worcester stated that it had been decided to shut down the livestream. The post said avian flu could be the cause of the bird's sudden sickness as it displayed three to four symptoms. ""No interest was shown when the adult female landed with prey and proceeded to eat it the box. ""This would also explain why the chick stumbled backwards onto the ledge yesterday.

554430,Why does Scotland use more water than the rest of the UK?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q0j07l9dxo,"People in Scotland have been told touse water supplies sparinglyafter the driest start to the year since 1964. But supplier Scottish Water is also warning that the country's relationship with water is unsustainable in the long run. This is because the average person in Scotland uses about 40% more water than the average person in Yorkshire. So why does Scotland use more water than the rest of the UK? Scotland has some of the wettest parts of the UK, so it is perhaps counterintuitive to think about it as a country facing water scarcity. One challenge is the fact that only around 1% of the country's infamous rainfall is captured in reservoirs. Another supply issue is that Scotland gets through so much water compared to the rest of the UK. Figures from regulator Ofwatshow that in 2023/24 an average of 140.4 litres of water per person per day was used in England and Wales. Yorkshire Water's rate in this period was 126.9 litres per day, while Northumbrian Water was 154.7 litres per day. By contrast, Scottish Water's consumption rate was an average of 178 litres per day. The way Scots pay for water offers one possible explanation for the bigger consumption rates. About half of households in England and Wales have a water meter, so they only pay for the amount they use, plus a standing charge. Only a small number of Scottish households have water meters. Instead, most pay for water and sewerage services as part of their council tax, with the amount linked to their property's council tax band. This means that for many in Scotland the only time they see how much they pay for water is when they see the annual council tax statement. Research has shown that households with meters use less water as they are more aware of how much their usage is costing them.  A fact rolled out on most school trips to Loch Ness is that it contains more fresh water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined. In a country with 30,000 freshwater lochs, water scarcity is not usually high on the agenda. But it is this perception of abundance that troubles Scottish Water's chief executive Alex Plant. Speaking to theBBC podcast ScotCast in February, he said: ""We're at a point where we are really worried, collectively as a nation, about the sufficiency of our water supply. ""So we should be thinking about water not as plentiful and abundant and you don't need to worry about it, and more as something that is a precious resource. ""Part of it is this mindset that we assume it's abundant and therefore we don't worry about it too much."" He added: ""I think another reason is that almost nobody in Scotland understands how much water they're using because we pay through our council tax (and) we don't understand the amount we're using."" Scotland is also facing more frequent spells without rain. Climate change models predict that summers in Scotland will likely become drier, with a potential decrease of 10% to 20% in summer rainfall. An opinion polling by Consumer Scotlandsuggests most consumers (77%) in Scotland are concerned about climate change. However, only around one in five (19%) are concerned about how much water is used in their home. Creating a better understanding of the link between the impact of climate change and water usage is what Mr Plant wants to address. Although households are the biggest users of water in Scotland, its industrial uses are also a factor in the overall consumption rates. Water - both rainfall and surface water - is critical to the production of the country's most famous export, whisky. This is why distilleries are paying close attention to projections that suggest there will bedouble the frequency of low river flow events by 2050. Elsewhere, water from rivers and burns is also vital to Scotland's agricultural sector. Soft fruit and vegetable production, mainly based in the south and east of the country, often requires large volumes of water to irrigate crops. This is especially true in dry periods like the current one. Heavy industry like chemical plants are also big consumers of water, with the Grangemouth industrial complex historically one of the biggest daily users of mains water in the UK. Part of Scottish Water's plan to try and get Scotland's consumption rates closer to English rates is to get people thinking about the water they use. The utility firm is embarking on a pilot project in Dundee to install ""smart"" monitors for around 2,000 homes over a three-year period. It is hoped this will help customers understand their water usage and improve Scottish Water's ability to find and fix leaks. Mr Plant said: ""It's a monitor rather than a meter because you're not going to pay for it. ""We'd be able to start showing people what they're using, not to charge by the usage, but just to show people what they are using. ""Understanding what you're using encourages a different relationship with the thing you're using."" A water firm wants to put more than 150 telegraph poles in Great Yarmouth to monitor usage. The goal of limiting warming to 1.5C is too high to avoid continued sea-level rise, scientists warn.

The now completed Bailiwick Bat Surveywas a volunteer-led initiative organised by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), the States of Guernsey and Bailiwick La Sociétés and wildlife trusts. Between 2021 and 2024, 420 volunteers collected more than 16 million bat sound recordings, which included six bat species never previously recorded in the Bailiwick. Julia Henney, the States' senior natural environment officer, said the survey would have taken one researcher decades to complete and would have cost up to £2m. Volunteers who signed up to the survey were able to borrow sound recording equipment, which was installed in areas across the Bailiwick for up to seven nights. The recordings were uploaded to theBTO's Acoustic Pipelinefor analysis, providing initial results within hours. ""This survey has changed and broadened our understanding of bats across the Bailiwick of Guernsey,"" said Ms Henney. ""This has all been possible thanks to keen volunteers getting stuck in, increasing community awareness of nature, as intended through Guernsey's Strategy for Nature."" She added: ""It would've taken one researcher over 45 years to gather this amount of data, potentially costing up to £2m, which serves to highlight the value of our community's efforts in gathering this insightful data."" Volunteers conducted 9,426 nights of recording at 2,364 locations, collecting more than 16 million triggered sound recordings. Four million bat identifications were confirmed, including the presence of 14 bat species, six of which were never previously recorded in the Bailiwick. Four of the six newly recorded species, serotine, Leisler's bat, common noctule and parti-coloured bat, are rare visitors to the islands. While the lesser horseshoe bat and whiskered or Brandt's bat appeared to be rare residents,according to the survey results. The study also found that underground tunnels from the Nazi German occupation were important roosting and hibernation sites for several of the rarer species of bats. BTO and the States of Guernsey worked in partnership with La Société Guernesiaise, Alderney WIldlife Trust and La Société Sercquaise on the project.

243468,Claims Red Arrows face solar glare risk rejected,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c706kjz3l28o,"An RAF source has dismissed claims that glare from solar farms could cause the Red Arrows to crash. In a House of Commons debate, Conservative MP Dr Caroline Johnson said light reflecting from panels could dazzle RAF pilots flying from air bases, including one  used for training aircrew. However, a senior RAF source told the PA news agency this was not the case and ""in general terms, solar panels across fields in Lincolnshire are not going to affect our pilots"". The Ministry of Defence and the RAF have been contacted for comment. Johnson, the MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, hit out at plans for large solar farms in her rural Lincolnshire constituency during a parliamentary debate on the issue, arguing they were inappropriate as they could hinder farmland productivity. She told the Commons earlier: ""I also ask the minister to give due consideration to the three RAF bases local to my constituency, RAF Waddington, RAF Cranwell and RAF Digby. ""Glint and glare from reflective panels will cause problems for pilots flying over these areas. ""Our newest pilots undergo basic training at Cranwell and RAF Waddington is home to the Red Arrows."" She said while it was ""a huge joy"" to watch the display team practising at high speeds, clusters of adjoining panels ""creating glint and glare could lead to disaster"". Labour MP Sarah Russell intervened to point out the pilots in countries such as Spain, where there are ""widespread solar panels"", did not have a problem. Johnson replied: ""I wonder if the average jumbo jet flying to Heathrow does a loop-the-loop on the way in?"" A senior RAF source, who had flown fast jets for more than two decades, said: ""At no point in my flying career did I ever have any problems with solar panels.

860559,Survey looks at women's mental health in farming,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y64zpyp2eo,"Trudy Herniman was 23 years old when her mother, a farmer's wife, took her own life. ""She wasn't someone who cried. She was very matter-of-fact and just got on with things,"" she said A survey by the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution (RABI) in 2021 found that 43% of women in rural areas were classified as either possibly or probably depressed. As part of a three-year study, researchers at the University of Exeter are seeking the views of women in farming to help improve the support provided for their health and wellbeing. Ms Herniman, 52, of South Molton, works as a field insurance advisor and makes it her job to offer support when needed. She said: ""You're invited into the farmhouse kitchen – people tell you about their worries, their fears, the challenges they are suffering. ""If I can prevent what happened to my mum from happening to someone else, I will. ""If I can get them to open up, then I will. That's her legacy."" She added that women were the backbone in farming, and she saw a huge amount of stress and burden put upon them. In 2021, The Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution (RABI) surveyed 15,296 people from across England and Wales (76% male, 23% female) It found: Carly Titmus, 44 works for the young suicide prevention charity, Papyrus. She visits livestock markets in the South West of England to promote awareness. She said: ""I have worked alongside women in our farming communities. ""There is a lot of discussion around isolation and feeling like they are not fitting in and getting time off the farm to have that break away."" Researchers are seeking the views of women in farming to help improve the support provided for their health and wellbeing. The research is led by the University of Exeter and the Farming Community Network (FCN) charity. Leaders said it aimed to better understand the physical and mental health of women working in agriculture - including potential stressors in farming and barriers to seeking support. The survey is part of the three-year research project and team members said they were keen to hear from all women over the age of 18 who were either living and/or working on farms. Researchers said the results would be shared with relevant public health bodies and policy makers. Dr Rebecca Wheeler, from the University of Exeter, who is leading the project, said: ""We want to hear about the experiences of women from across the UK – of all ages and backgrounds – and from different roles in agriculture."" Linda Jones, national manager (FCN Cymru), said: ""This is an important opportunity for women in farming to share their views and contribute to this new research. ""There has historically been limited research conducted into the health and wellbeing of women in farming – including both the positive aspects, as well as any unique stressors or barriers that may be faced and potential implications for their life choices.""

136926,Ancient woodland nature reserve to expand,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2jwwyjzr1o,"A conservation charity has acquired 100 acres of ancient woodland to expand an existing nature reserve. The Norfolk Wildlife Trust said that the new land would increase the size of its reserve at Foxley Wood, in North Norfolk, by more than a third. Parts of the woodland are known to have been there for 6,000 years, and it has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its value for wildlife. Steve Collin, an area manager for the trust, said they intended to use the expanded area to create a ""mosaic of habitats"". The Wildlife Trust said that the purchase of the land next to their existing reserve was made possible by several donations. They said that the most significant of these had come from legacies left to the trust by Graham Churchyard and Adrian Gunson. Tricia Gunson, Adrian's widow, is a ""wildlife guardian"" for the Trust. She said she was ""very happy to release Adrian's legacy to help with this purchase"", because they had ""always loved Norfolk, and its rich and varied wildlife"". Foxley Wood is Norfolk's largest area of ancient woodland. As well as using the expanded area to increase visitor access, the trust said it also hoped to create new habitats for rare plant life. Steve Collin, from the trust, explained that the wildlife they hoped the resulting plants would encourage included ""butterflies such as purple emperor and silver washed fritillary and birds including tree creepers and nuthatches"". ""We will create new and eco-friendly ways for people to enjoy some of Norfolk's most special wild places,"" he said.

340004,Retired couple 'devastated' by solar farm plans,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr5w17vrv2o,"A couple said plans that would leave their rural retirement cottage ""surrounded by 15ft (4.5m) solar panels"" were ""devastating"". Mandy Goodhand and Stevie Johnson-Mansley bought their cottage in rural Lincolnshire in 2020 to renovate and retire to. However,  three years later they received a ""knock on the door"" from a local farmer to inform them the surrounding fields were being leased to make way for solar panels. The couple's MP Dr Caroline Johnson, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, has secured a debate on the impact of large scale solar farms in the House of Commons later. ""I will be putting forwards the concerns both I and my constituents share about large-scale solar farms and their impact on agricultural land and our local area,"" she said. Five large solar farms have already been approved for Lincolnshire. These include theMallard Passproject which spans two counties and was strongly opposed by local residents. There are at least nine other solar projects planned in the county, including one near Mandy and Stevie's home in Howell Fen near Heckington. Developer Low Carbon wants to build the solar farm, known as the Beacon Fen Energy Park, which would be capable of powering up to 130,000 homes. The couple said it would lead to their rural smallholding being ""dominated"" by solar panels. Stevie, a retired nurse, said she felt there was little they could do to stop the proposal. ""It does appear that these projects are just being rubber-stamped, to be honest. I don't think local people's views come into it."" Mandy and Stevie welcomed the parliamentary debate on solar energy being led by their local MP. Mandy said: ""The bigger concern, apart from our own, is that land is being taken away - land that would normally be used for food."" Writing on her Facebook page, Johnson outlined the scope of Thursday's debate. ""I will be raising the cumulative effects of these proposals, the threat to our food security, the human impact on the villages the panels will surround and modern slavery concerns surrounding the production of solar panel components."" Low Carbon said it had ""engaged with many local residents""  to mitigate some of the impacts of its proposals and ""better understand their concerns"". A spokesperson said ""the land take involved for solar developments is minimal in the context of food production"" and said the solar industry was playing ""an important role in keeping farms viable"". Large solar farms are classed asNationally Significant Infrastructure Projects(NSIPS) which means they are ultimately decided on by government ministers rather than local councils. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy and Net Zero said the amount of farmland being used by solar projects should not be a concern. ""As of September last year, solar farms covered around 0.1% of the total land area of the UK,"" they said. The spokesperson added: ""Projects are subject to a rigorous planning process in which the views and interests of the local community and impacts on the local environment, including any impact on amenities, landscapes and land use, are considered."" Listen to highlights fromLincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch thelatest episode of Look Northor tell us about a story you think we should be coveringhere.

684016,Food waste collections coming to Brighton and Hove,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqeln7q7wxo,"Brighton & Hove City Council has approved food waste collections in the city. The new scheme, funded by the government and £1.2m from the local authority's budget, is set to be rolled out in stages from September. BHCC said the scheme would help boost recycling rates – which are ""historically low"" in the city - by getting food waste out of general refuse. Some residents raised concerns that food waste collections could lead to additional smells and traffic. Councillor Tim Rowkins, cabinet member for net zero and environmental services, said at a council meeting on Thursday the waste would be stored in sealed containers and removed in 24 hours. He added it would mean less smell and fewer vehicles. About a third of household rubbish in Brighton and Hove is food and drink waste, approximately 2.8kg per household each week, according to the council. BHCC said the food waste would be turned into compost for use in and around the city. Food waste collections are set to be extended to all households by March 2026. Kerbside collections will be made weekly, while communal food waste would be collected every day under the proposals.

235937,Thousands of trees planted in forest project,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj930p903e4o,"Almost 20,000 trees and shrubs have been planted in efforts to improve woodland in the North Pennines. North Pennines National Landscape (NPNL) said the three-year project involved working with about 120 landowners to identify 761 acres (308 hectares) as suitable for trees. The project focused on small woodlands and low-density wood pasture, with scrub and scattered canopy trees to work alongside farming systems, NPNL said. NPNL said the North Pennines was ""one of the least wooded areas of England"" and the initiative looked to ""bridge the gap"" between the existing Great Northumberland National Forest and the Northern Forest. The North Pennines covers much of the west of County Durham together with parts of Northumberland and Cumbria,according to Durham Landscapes. The NPNL said it worked with 37 landowners to secure funding for tree planting spanning 128 acres (52 hectares). NPNL advised the landowners to plant different species of native trees, including aspen, wild cherry and crab apple, and shrub such as blackthorn. The group said it also identified areas where tree planting would have the least negative effect on wading bird populations, which rely on open landscapes. NPNL's Sarah Tooze said: ""The project focused on the kinds of tree cover - small scale woodlands and low-density wood pasture with scrub and scattered canopy trees - which work alongside nature friendly farming systems and will improve the landscape for biodiversity and other public goods.""

211366,How an orphaned lamb changed estate agent's life,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4kp23718po,"Flashy cars, a prestige job and plenty of money - high-flying estate agent Stephen Keighley had it all. Underneath, he knew ""something was badly wrong"". ""One morning I was driving to work, and tears started coming down my face,"" he said. ""I pulled over, rang into work and said, 'I'm not coming in' and they said, 'will you be back tomorrow' and I said, 'No I'm never coming back' and that was it."" Mr Keighley left his London life of 25 years and moved back to Cornwall, where he had grown up. Despite being back home, he still struggled. That was until five years ago when a friend gave him an orphaned lamb named Benny to care for - giving him a purpose that ""changed his life"". ""Having to care for Benny 24/7 and help him survive gave me a motivation and a purpose in life that perhaps I had been missing for a few years,"" Mr Keighley explained. ""My mental health wasn't in the greatest place in the world and perhaps Benny came along at the right time for me."" Mr Keighley, who grew up in Launceston, then bought two more sheep to keep Benny company and soon realised  he had found his calling - to be a shepherd. He now has a flock of 38 rare breed sheep having swapped his office for fields near Vixen Tor on Dartmoor, in Devon. ""It's a complete and utter contrast from what I was doing and what I did for the majority of my life,"" he said. ""I used to drag myself out of bed when the alarm went off, put on a sharp suit and go to work. ""Now I spend my days in tatty clothes covered in sheep poo, but I no longer need an alarm - as soon as the sun comes up, I can't wait to get out here."" He said he would not change a thing. ""I've learnt a lot from sheep in terms of life experience,"" he said. ""They've taught me how to just 'be'. ""Just to stand back and watch their social interactions, the way they happily spend their days happily grazing and lying around, that taught me life doesn't have to be as fast-paced as mine had been. ""It's given me time to reflect and to work out what's important in life."" As for Benny, he is now a fully grown ram. Mr Keighley, who kept him as a pet, said he was definitely not for sale.

677545,Onshore wind farm project within budget - chairman,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80kv5d7lp7o,"The initial costs of an onshore wind farm project have been higher than expected but the scheme is still within budget, the chairman of Manx Utilities has said. John Wannenburgh MHK confirmed £3.14m had so far been spent on ""predevelopment costs"" for the Cair Vie project at Earystane and Scard in the south of the Isle of Man. Although ""additional survey work"" was required after environmental scoping feedback, the government-owned firm believed the plan remained ""financially viable"", he said. Concerns were raised about ""rising costs"" in the House of Keys on Tuesday, with calls for the project to be scrapped or moved to another site. The proposed plans, which would see up to five turbines built in the area able to deliver a quarter of the island's annual electricity needs, are part of the government's commitment to decarbonise the island's energy supply by 2030. There were calls by Chris Thomas MHK for the scheme to be moved as the current £40m projected cost was in line with that outlined previously for a scheme at Sulby and Druidale in the north of the island. Jason Moorhouse MHK questioned if the cost of the project had ""almost doubled"" when compared to paperwork issued by Manx Utilities in July 2023 that put the price of the scheme at £23.5m. In response, Wannenburgh said that lower figure had been the ""indicative"" price of the components needed at the time, but not the full cost of the overall project. He said predevelopment costs for onshore wind farms were typically 10% to 15% of the overall spend. That had so far covered ecological surveys, feasibility work, consultants, project management and network connection investigations, he said. It had also involved engaging with stakeholders, and the additional ecological surveys, which were underway following feedback on the environmental scoping report. The £40m overall figure was ""consistent"" with the original costsoutlined by Manx Utilitiesin July 2023 and it would be ""irresponsible"" to stop the process and relocate, he said. ""We must see the process though from where it is, and we will make final decisions when the final environmental impact assessment is reported,"" he added.

It is thought the bird of prey was targeted near to Beck Hole Road, Goathland, on 2 May, according to North Yorkshire Police. Its rural task force appealed for any witnesses or anyone who saw people acting suspiciously in the area at the time to contact police. Buzzards and all other birds of prey are legally protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, meaning to intentionally kill or injure one is a criminal offence. Anyone convicted of doing so could be at risk of receiving an unlimited fine or up to six months in jail, the force said. Tom Hind, chief executive officer of the North York Moors National Park Authority, said: ""We are appalled to once again be addressing the suspected illegal killing of a bird of prey in the North York Moors. ""That we are having to repeat this message highlights the ongoing and unacceptable threat posed to wildlife in our region.""

756421,Plans for battery energy storage site proposed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqglv98dn4o,"Plans have been unveiled to house more than 100 batteries in storage containers on farmland near a Kent village. Anglo Renewables has applied to Dartford Borough Council for planning permission for the energy storage facility in Greenhithe. Documents submitted to the authority on 29 April said the renewables firm wants to build a battery energy storage system (BESS) off Bean Lane in Greenhithe. It is not yet known when the planning committee will decide on the bid although a target deadline of 29 July has been set, while the public can comment on the plans until 30 May, reports theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. ""The site comprises a 3.7 hectare [9 acre] parcel of land that is currently in agricultural use,"" the company wrote. It insists that as the proposal is ""fully reversible"", any land would not be ""permanently or irreversibly lost,"" and only about half the farmland will be built on. BESS systems are intended to store energy, largely from renewable sources, so that it can be deployed into the grid when there is demand to avoid wasting energy. ""The 104 megawatts of storage of the site can meet the average electricity needs of 215,000 homes for two hours,"" planning documents said The batteries themselves will be stored in metal containers ""similar in appearance to a ubiquitous profiled steel shipping container."" The site is set to have 24/7 CCTV coverage and fences all around. Anglo Renewables also say there will be a ""biodiversity net gain"" as part of their plans through a ""broadleaved planting area"" forming ""an extension to Darenth Wood"". They also propose that the development will only be temporary, and after 40 years the facility will be decommissioned and removed, and the land returned to agricultural use.

1069044,Damaged pipes blamed for surge in sewage alerts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1757zgdzx9o,"A water company says damaged pipes and broken valves are to blame for an increase in the number of sewage pollution alerts on an East Yorkshire beach. Data from Surfers Against Sewage shows there were 31 alerts in 2024, compared with four in 2022. Yorkshire Water said the alert system had been accidentally triggered due to two damaged outflow pipes and two damaged valves which had been letting in seawater. The company said it was spending £1.3m on repairs. When investigating the spill alerts, engineers discovered ground subsidence had caused damage to two underground pipes. A plastic pipe was found compressed into an oval shape and a concrete pipe had partially collapsed, allowing groundwater into the system. Two damaged valve flaps were allowing seawater to enter the combined sewer overflow and accidentally trigger pollution alerts. Miles Cameron, Yorkshire Water's bathing water strategic partnerships manager, said the repair work on the beach was part of a wider five-year £300m investment programme along the Yorkshire coast. ""It got Blue Flag status which is fantastic and gives bathers and customers the confidence they can come to Hornsea,"" he said. ""This is really just about fixing a pipe to make sure it's there for many years to come."" Visitors to Hornsea toldBBC Radio Humbersidetheir confidence in beach cleanliness had diminished. Mally Armitage said he had not used the beach due to ""the raw sewage that's been pumped into the ocean and the recent incident with the tanker"", referring toa collison between a tanker carrying aviation fuel and a cargo shipin March. Jerry Ashton said: ""You can't have inaccurate information otherwise there's no point having any information is there? ""It doesn't worry me too much but, if I was a surfer, and we do have surfers here, or one of the ladies that goes swimming in it, then I'd be extremely concerned.""

800613,Farmer's yield concerns after no 'meaningful rain',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgle9pdz8gdo,"Farmers in Kent say they are facing reduced yields at their next harvest due to exceptionally dry weather. The Environment Agencywarned in Maythat, although there was not currently a drought in England, there was a ""medium risk of one this summer"". The UK ison course for its driest spring in over a centuryand April 2025 was the sunniest on record. Andy Barr, an arable farmer in the village of Lenham, said his crops ""haven't had any meaningful rain for three or four weeks now"". Mr Barr said he was concerned that his plants were shorter, paler and already developing ears of grain, which he would not expect to see ""for a couple of weeks"". ""The plant is telling me it's under stress, it can't take up the nutrients it wants, it's thinking, 'I'm going to die soon, I better produce some seeds',"" he said. ""That means less yield for us at the end of the day."" Dry weather has contributed to the area of the UK burnt by wildfires alreadyreaching a higher levelthan the total for any year in more than a decade. On one day in March, Kent Fire & Rescue Service wascalled to three wildfires in one day. Mr Barr said helost crops to fire in 2022. ""The flames were higher than me. It was noisy as you can imagine, and it looked so ferocious I thought we were never going to put it out,"" he said. The farmer is urging members of the public to think carefully about disposing of rubbish. He added: ""The fire brigade thought it could have been something as simple as a bottle discarded months earlier, but because the sun got so intense and everything was so dry, it just caught light and literally set fire to 50 acres of crop."" The dry weather is set to continue in the short term, according to BBC South East weather presenter Nina Ridge. She said: ""The next seven days look as if they're going to be dry, but there are increasing signs that at the end of next week the jet stream will move further south and we'll see low pressure systems bringing us some significant rain for the end of May."" The prolonged dry weather is linked to what are called ""blocking highs"" when a high pressure weather system becomes stuck. Scientists do not know if this blocked pattern is linked to climate change. Global warming is expected to cause more extreme weather events globally. Studies about our future climate suggest more and longer periods of dry weather as well as periods of less rainfall in the UK. Winters are likely to be wetter and warmer.

2286,Sadness as 'majestic presence' Hugo the lion dies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9893rdgy2vo,"In his prime he was a ""majestic presence"" who drew awe from visitors to one of Wales' top tourist destinations. But the effects of age catch up with even the king of the jungle with the news that Hugo the 17-year-old lion has died. Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo in Pembrokeshire announced ""with heavy hearts"" the passing of their beloved male African lion following a short illness. ""Our thoughts are with our keeping team who are feeling his loss most deeply,"" it said in a statement. Hugo arrived at the attraction near Tenby in 2014 with his mate Luna and their four cubs - Sola, Zahra, Alika, and Ebele - and swiftly became a ""firm favourite"" among staff and visitors. Following the illness it was discovered he was suffering from chronic kidney disease, a progressive and irreversible condition common in older big cats. The decision was taken to put him down due to his age, given more episodes of illness were likely. ""It is with very heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved Hugo,"" the statement read. ""His recent illness was determined to be an uraemic episode and sadly, more episodes were likely. ""Following an ethical review and given Hugo's age and the nature of his condition, the difficult but humane decision to provide a dignified goodbye to him was taken to prevent further suffering.""

591558,Endangered Indian rhino calf born at safari park,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9ygew7yn2o,"Keepers at a safari park have welcomed the birth of a rare Indian rhinoceros calf. The baby rhino arrived at West Midlands Safari Park (WMSP) in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 6 May. The female calf is the second successful Indian rhino birth at the Park in its 52-year history - the first was the calf's half-brother in 2020. The safari park said both mum and baby were doing well, after keepers had to step in to assist with the birth. Veterinary nurse Sarah Smith said: ""After a long, restless night monitoring the CCTV, the team continued their normal morning checks and found her behavioural changes that confirmed her labour was progressing. ""When we hadn't seen the usual progression we expected, closer inspection showed us there were back feet visible, telling us we had an abnormal delivery."" The Indian rhino, also known as greater one-horned rhino, is classed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. They are found in India and Nepal, but face threats such as poaching, habitat destruction and conflict with humans. In the 19th Century they were hunted almost to extinction. ""A breech birth brings many difficulties, and research shows a large number require intervention and usually end in calf mortality. ""This can also lead to the mother's life being in danger, so we knew we had a short window of time to act. We were able to apply calving ropes to the calf's hind legs and assist Sunny with her contractions and help birth the calf. ""We're so proud of her and the team,"" Ms Smith added.

The three Bronze Age objects were found in March 2022 and date back to about 1400–1150 BCE. Known as the Crichel Hoard, the bent ornaments have been valued at £9,000 and Dorset Museum is fundraising to acquire, conserve and display them. The museum said they shed ""new light on Bronze Age life in southern England"". The collection is made up of a twisted gold ribbon torc bracelet, a gold strip thought to be part of a larger piece of jewellery, and a spiralled gold bracelet weighing 46g (1.6 oz). Jon Marrow, of Dorset Museum, said: ""One of the most interesting things about this hoard is that the gold twisted torc is of a type normally found further north and west. ""It's also intriguing that such objects are so often damaged before burial, as though this was done ritually but it's hard for us to discern what the beliefs were behind this practice."" The museum said £8,000 had already been raised through the Arts Council England and V&A Purchase Grant Fund, and The Headley Trust.

183065,All you need to know about the 2025 Balmoral Show,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvknn422lmo,"The 156th Balmoral Show started on Wednesday at Balmoral Park outside Lisburn. Thousands of people are expected to attend, with four days of sunshine forecast. It is the culmination of months of planning for the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and for the farmers competing with their livestock. Despite being involved in more than 30 shows, the RUAS group operations director Rhonda Geary still gets excited. ""The weather plays a big part in it, but it's always a great event and great to see it all come together after a year of planning,"" she said. ""There's everything, from the livestock classes to sheep shearing, our kids' area with the children's farm, our equestrian areas, our horticulture, our food which is so important, and then we have our shopping halls filled with trade stands."" For farmers like William Irvine, president of the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU),it is a chance to catch up with friendsand show off the fruits of their hard labour in preparing animals for competition. ""Balmoral is a day out, a day to meet folk that we maybe didn't meet since this time last year, it's a day to enjoy, a day to catch up with our friends and colleagues,"" he said. ""It's a shop window for our pedigree breeders, our livestock breeders and all the various sectors within agriculture will be represented at the show."" Inheritance tax was an issue at the forefront of many of those attending the show. From April 2026, a 20% inheritance tax rate will apply to agricultural assets over a £1m threshold. The Treasury believes that, with careful financial planning, about 500 estates a year will be liable to pay the tax, but DAERA says its research showsalmost half of all farms in Northern Ireland will pass the threshold, due to land values alone, with the dairy sector particularly badly hit. First Minister Michelle O'Neill told the Red Lines podcast that although the issue of inheritance tax rests with the Treasury it ""doesn't mean you don't do anything about it"". ""You still continue to fight, it was only a few months ago that we were all here as political parties, standing with farmers side by side in saying no to the Treasury and the new government around the fact that this is the wrong policy to take. ""It will have more implications for farmers here than it will for farmers across the water."" Agriculture Minister Andrew Muir said that there is ""is a lot of anxiety and anger"" in relation to the issue of inheritance tax. He added that this stems from ""the UK government's failure to engage"". Muir added that farmers do have a case and that there would be a ""disproportionate and detrimental impact towards farming in Northern Ireland, because it is made up of family farms"". He said that the UK government needs to ""have a bit of reflection"" and ""a bit more engagement around these issues"". UFU's Mr Irvine, also speaking to the podcast, said in a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn he continued to apply pressure. ""We have smaller farm businesses, but we've a significantly higher land value and that leaves us vulnerable. ""The £1m threshold only lets a relatively small holding avoid this tax."" The chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi MP, said the union had given evidence to it. ""We are aware how it is disproportionate in Northern Ireland, how the inheritance tax will affect them. We are aware and have raised our concerns with government and will continue to do so."" Speaking earlier to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Muir said he had ""been looking forward to the show for months"". ""This is a real proud celebration of agri-food in Northern Ireland and there is so much we can be proud of,"" he said. ""The real favourite part for me is being able to see all the fantastic animals that we have here. ""There's so many examples in terms of pigs, sheep and there is the cattle ring. ""We have the highest welfare standards in Northern Ireland and we should be able to showcase that to so many people."" More than 3,500 animals will be on display over the course of four days. Although there will not be any poultry competitions this year because ofbird flu restrictions, there will be countless cattle, sheep, pig and horse competitions, not to mention the guinea pigs, rabbits and a small display of birds from a single flock. The show has evolved over the years to reflect the changing face of agriculture. A sustainability village will showcase the green innovations being introduced in farming to help reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. And the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) will be demonstrating a model farm of the future. Prof Elizabeth Magowan from AFBI said Balmoral was the ""perfect platform"" to share the scientific work they do to develop farming systems that are both environmentally and economically responsible. ""The AFBI team get a lot of value from the many discussions that take place with our farming community and the wider community who attend the show. ""We often learn as much from the folk that visit the stand as they learn from us."" The Balmoral Show takes place at the Eikon Exhibition Centre at Lisburn's Balmoral Park. The show runs over four days from Wednesday to Saturday and opens at 09:30 BST each day. It closes at 18:00 on Wednesday and Saturday, 20:00 on Thursday and 19:00 on Friday. Those travelling to the event are encouraged to make use of public transport. If you are travelling by train, the nearest station is at Lisburn which is less than 15 minutes away from the event. A free shuttle service will run from the station to the showgrounds, operating regularly throughout the day. The last shuttle bus will leave 30 minutes after the show closes each day. By car: Car parking is available on site for £10 per car each day, which must be paid by cash on arrival. Organisers have warned there will be queues arriving and leaving the showgrounds at peak times. Tickets must be bought online in advance and cannot be purchased at the gate.

954296,How firms are coping one year after water parasite,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk20en0m3zo,"People in the south Devon fishing town of Brixham remember 15 May 2024 for all the wrong reasons. That was date the UK Health Security Agency confirmed the parasitecryptosporidium was present in tap water in the area, with South West Water (SWW) confirming the contamination of the water supply in the town the next day. A boil notice was issued for thousands of properties, with bottled water handed to stricken residents. More than100 confirmed cases of the diarrhoea-type illnesswere ultimately linked to the Brixham outbreak. The ripple effects of the outbreak continue but some firms in the town said there was hope. Josy Byrne, Post Office manager at nearby Kingswear, fell ill from the cryptosporidium bug on 10 May. ""I've never been so sick in my entire life,"" she said. ""I lost 15lb (6.8kg) in three days and was sick for the whole summer."" She said she continued to suffer from irritable bowel syndrome as a result of the infection. The outbreak had a significant impact on local tourism, with holiday homes remaining empty as visitors cancelled their plans, she said. ""It did hurt the businesses in the area because nobody wanted to come anymore,"" she said. In November 2024 SWWpledged £1.2m to help boost tourismand repair what business leaders described as ""reputational damage"" following the outbreak. Carolyn Custerson, chief executive of the English Riviera BID Company, which aims to increase business in the area, said the strategy to reflect Brixham and the English Riviera in a positive light appeared to be having an impact, with an ""increase in family booking numbers"" over Easter. SWW had ""given us the support that has enabled us to run campaigns aimed at encouraging people to come to Brixham and the surrounding Torbay area this summer,"" she said. ""We are looking forward to welcoming past and new visitors to our beautiful region."" Andrew Stockman, who runs a picture gallery and amusement arcade in Brixham, said business had been rocked by the outbreak. ""We have seen a lot of regulars who were put off for a year find somewhere else,"" he said. ""It's been really significant, the streets are quieter and it will probably be two or three years before it recovers. ""These things really do affect small towns like ours."" SWW had offered him £500 compensation for both businesses, a fraction of what he reckoned he lost. The ""older crowd"" that were regular visitors had also been put off by higher costs of living, he said. John Ingram, owner of the Bay Coffee Company, said the outbreak turned Brixham into a ""ghost town"". ""It had a really devastating effect for about nine to 12 weeks,"" he said, adding the ripple effects continued throughout the year with slower bookings and harder trade. He estimated that his business lost about 25-30% of its revenue during the crisis. Despite the challenges, he said: ""We've got to keep positive and keep working at this."" He said he was confident about the upcoming summer, with several festivals planned. ""Big smiles, great sunshine. Come and visit us here in Devon,"" he said. SWW said in a statement it was ""sorry for what happened in Brixham last year"". ""While we can't undo what happened, we have made already made improvements to make sure it cannot happen here again,"" it said. ""Our focus is firmly on the future for customers and communities and we are working to support local tourism in the area.

965276,Shelter appeals for help after kitten 'surge',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0719j13k87o,"An animal shelter says it is experiencing an ""overwhelming surge"" in vulnerable cats and kittens being brought in. The Cotswolds Dogs & Cats Home, near Cambridge in Gloucestershire, is appealing for donations after taking in about 50 cats so far in 2025, at a rate of about three cats per week, including litters of kittens and pregnant females. The charity said basic veterinary treatment for cats has already cost it thousands of pounds in the first half of the year. Sam Herniman, individual giving fundraiser, said: ""With abandonments soaring and rescue centres stretched to capacity, we're concerned about the months ahead."" The RSPCA released figures in November which highlighted a 51% rise in the number of animals being abandoned in England and Wales from 2021. The increase is thought to be due to the cost of living crisis and surge of pet ownership during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Cotswold Dogs & Cats Home said the figures paint a ""stark picture of the deepening animal welfare crisis in the UK"". It said it needs donations to provide food, safety and veterinary care to the neglected animals at its shelter until they find new owners. Among the 48 cats it has taken in already this year, the shelter said it had two litters of kitten and two heavily-pregnant female cats in its care. Ms Herniman said: ""Behind these shocking statistics are the faces of a vulnerable animals, each a precious life in urgent need of care. ""This kitten season could be one of the busiest we've ever faced and we're calling on animal lovers to join forces and donate, so together we can be there for every cat and kitten that needs us.""

1029273,Next 10 days crucial for farmers 'praying' for rain,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmknz78n29o,"A twofold blow of record sunshine and low rainfall has left crops in ""survival mode"" and struggling to grow, a farmer has warned. The Met Office previously confirmed April 2025saw the most sunshine in the UK since records began 115 years ago- with 47% more hours of sunshine than the long-term average. The recent weather follows England's wettest 18-month period between October 2022 and March 2024, which caused damage to the soil,according the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Arable farmer Nigel Friend raises animals and grows crops at Cranborne Chase in Dorset, he said unless the weather improved in the next ten days, there could be grain shortages. Mr Friend told BBC Radio Solent presenter Steve Harris he had been farming all his life and this year, farmers needed ""significant amounts of rainfall"". ""Crops are suffering, the increased heat is causing problems for animals as well, with things like fly strike on sheep being very early this year and obviously we're preserving our foraged stocks for the winter ahead, because we don't have any grass,"" he explained. Mr Friend said farmers across the UK had ""suffered two horrendously wet years"", which had damaged the soil, but after the recent dry weather he was now finding cracks on his farm at least 10in (25.4cm) deep. George Brown, who grows porridge oats, spring barley and white clover on Priors Farm in Peasemore near Newbury, shares Mr Friend's concerns. He said: ""You've got to remind yourself you've been very lucky to have the sun at your back, but really I've been praying for rain for the last six weeks. ""We wanted some rain to get the crops growing out of the ground, but it just hasn't turned up."" Elsewhere in Basingstoke, Hampshire, Ian Constable said he had been forced to adapt the way his farm was feeding its animals. Mr Constable, who Street Croft Farm in Herriard, explained: ""Obviously no rain, so no grass growth. ""We've got a few hundred lambs and ewes running around and there's not a lot for them to eat. ""All the grass just hasn't taken off this year, which means we're supplementary feeding everything, buying in a lot of feed to keep them fed and healthy."" Alan Hutton, chair of Hampshire's National Farmers' Union, added: ""Farming is an extraordinarily risky occupation. ""I want to reassure the public there is not going to be a food shortage this year, but please if you're coming to the countryside, treat it with respect. ""It is going to be very, very dry this summer, so please don't go smoking and throwing cigarettes out the window and that sort of thing – it is your food supply after all."" Mr Friend is expecting dry weather for another 10 weeks based on long-range forecasting, but said the next 10 days would be ""crucial"" for farmers. ""Normally by now you would expect wheat to be knee high, at the moment it's halfway between your ankle and your knee. ""The weather over the next 10 days will make the difference between us having reasonable crop to harvest and a disastrous crop due to the lack of moisture."" Mr Friend's concerns come after the Environment Agencywarned there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought. The Met Office told BBC Weather the UK had experienced an average rainfall accumulation of 80mm so far this spring, compared to an average of 229mm, making it the driest spring on record.

552544,Pair ordered to pay £11k over animal cruelty,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1n8ll54xo,"A pair of smallholders who ""failed to provide the most basic care"" have been banned from keeping farm animals for five years and orderd to pay more than £11,000. Paul Ford and Rebecca Austin, of Little Chacewood Farm and Farm Shop, Truro, pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to five charges of animal cruelty involving poultry and pigs. The court heard how Cornwall Council's animal health and environmental health teams had previously visited the smallholding and provided advice and guidance, which was ignored. Ford and Austin, both aged 35, were ordered to pay a total of £11,423 in fines and court costs. Stephanie Martin, senior Trading Standards officer at Cornwall Council, said: ""Mr Ford and Miss Austin had been offered considerable advice over a number of years. ""They completely ignored this advice and failed to provide the most basic care to their animals."" The court was told at the hearing last Thursday how the pair failed to provide bedding and fresh water and kept the animals in hazardous conditions where there was scrap metal, old machinery and live electrical wires. It also heard how Ford and Austin failed to correctly store and dispose poultry slaughter waste and failed to control a rat infestation. Kevin Brader, head of Public Protection at Cornwall Council, said: ""This case is a distressing example of smallholders attempting to farm without the appropriate knowledge. ""Where individuals do not provide adequate care for their animals, we will take enforcement action to safeguard industry standards."" Ford was ordered to pay a fine of £778, a surcharge of £311, and to contribute £8,000 towards the council's costs. Austin was ordered to pay a fine of £180, a surcharge of £65 and was also ordered to contribute £2,089 towards costs. Follow BBC Cornwall onX,FacebookandInstagram.

847614,Captain comes home on the 'biggest' ship around,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj9gl2x8jo,"The captain of a huge ship docked in Hull has described it affectionately as ""the biggest and baddest"" around. Robert Southwell, from the Beverley area, is master of the Wind Peak, a purpose-built vessel that is being used to transport wind turbine components from a Siemens Gamesa plant to the Sofia offshore wind farm in the North Sea. He said he was proud to be back in Hull after spending 20 years at sea. ""We plan to be on this project for the next year and it is certainly nice for me, being local, to come in and out of Hull,"" he added. ""It's the first time I have done it other than [on] the ferry."" The BBC's Richard Stead was shown around the vessel, which is 162m (530ft) long and 60m (196ft) wide. It was built for Cadeler, a Danish firm that installs offshore wind farms, and left a shipyard in China last summer beforearriving in Hull in March. The Wind Peak is so large, it can carry enough equipment to build six turbines at a time. Mr Southwell and his crew construct them and then connect them to the grid. They live on the ship for four weeks at a time, before taking four weeks' leave. Mr Southwell admitted he is looking forward to being closer to his wife, 21-month-old son and relatives in East Yorkshire, after being so far away from home at sea. ""I enjoy the fact that many of my friends and relatives can see the vessel from their homes,"" he added of the new local landmark. Mr Southwell said it took about 14 hours for the Wind Peak to reach the Dogger Bank, where the farm is being built. ""It is a fair way out, but there's a lot of activity out of there,"" he added. ""Interestingly for this area, the electricity that's generated by these turbines runs through the substation ashore at Skipsea and then up to Creyke Beck [in Cottingham], and that's where it's plugged into the National Grid.""

175930,Power plant bosses concerned as subsidy cuts loom,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861q2gld1xo,"Bosses of a biogas power plant in Warwickshire say they are worried about its future after the government revealed subsidies for the industry are to be axed. Cotesbach Landfill Gas Project, near Rugby, traps methane from rotting organic rubbish in landfill and uses it to generate green energy. David Rice, managing director of Melton CLP - which runs the site - said that when the renewable energy subsidy is withdrawn in 2027, it will force 87% of sites like this plant to ""close overnight"". The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said it was exploring options to support the sector meeting net zero targets as well as addressing the interests of bill-payers. ""Electricity produced from landfill gas generators plays an important role in increasing our energy security, while turning off the tap of future methane emissions and helping deliver net zero,"" it added. Melton CLP also runs 18 other sites and said that each year the gas they capture would power about 90,000 homes across the country. ""Not only would you lose the benefit of the renewable energy that comes from them, but also you'd see an increase in methane emissions across the UK,"" said Mr Rice. Paul Cleary, who owns the plant near Rugby, explained that he and his team mine for pockets of methane emitting from the waste. Methane is generated by a number of things, including garden waste, kitchen scraps and nappies. The gas is extracted and used to power large engines that, in turn, generate green electricity. He told the BBC the plant's work was important. ""If we weren't here and you had the waste inside a landfill site, the methane would build in pressure and it would start to smell,"" he said. ""It would obviously create environment issues if no-one was here doing what we do."" Outside the industry, others are also concerned. Liam Hardy, head of research at environmental charity Green Alliance, said the UK was signed up to several treaties promising to reduce methane emissions, and this industry was a vital part of doing that. He told the BBC that if the industry collapsed because of the move by the government, it would be a ""disaster"" for climate change. ""Because it's also really short-lived in the atmosphere, actually tackling methane emissions can have an immediate effect,"" he said. ""We should be thinking of action on methane as the emergency brake on climate change."" Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.
